# The Essex Constraint Satisfaction Tradition

## Summary

The University of Essex has been a significant centre for constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) research since the late 1980s. The connection between CSP and AI planning is deep — many planning problems are naturally expressed as constraint satisfaction problems, and the techniques developed at Essex for CSP have direct application to plan representation and search.

### Edward Tsang

Professor of Computer Science at the University of Essex. Author of the foundational textbook on constraint satisfaction:

- Tsang, E. (1993). *Foundations of Constraint Satisfaction*. Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-701610-4.

This was the first attempt to define the scope of constraint satisfaction as a field. It remains the most cited work on the subject. The book was suggested by Sam Steel, connecting the planning and constraint satisfaction threads at Essex.

Lecturer in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering. Research spanning AI planning (see `STEEL_AND_HO.md`) and the intersection of planning with constraint satisfaction. Co-editor of the ECP'97 proceedings.

## The Planning-CSP Connection

### Planning as Constraint Satisfaction

A plan can be viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem:
- **Variables:** The actions to include, their parameters, their ordering
- **Domains:** The possible actions, parameter values, time slots
- **Constraints:** Preconditions must be met, resources must not be over-allocated, threats must be resolved, causal links must be preserved

This view was formalized by several researchers:

- Kautz, H. & Selman, B. (1992). "Planning as Satisfiability." *ECAI-92*. — Showed that planning problems can be encoded as SAT (Boolean satisfiability) problems and solved by SAT solvers. Led to the SATPLAN and Blackbox systems.

- Do, M.B. & Kambhampati, S. (2001). "Planning as Constraint Satisfaction: Solving the Planning Graph by Compiling it into CSP." *Artificial Intelligence*, 132(2), pp. 151–182.

### O-Plan's Constraint Model

Austin Tate's O-Plan (see `O-PLAN.md`) used an explicitly constraint-based plan representation — the \<I-N-C-A\> ontology. This is the direct bridge between Edinburgh's planning tradition and the constraint satisfaction formalism.

## Why This Matters for intentïon

intentïon's plan format (PLAN.md) is implicitly a constraint satisfaction problem:

| Plan section | CSP analog |
|---|---|
| **Achieved** | Assigned variables (solved) |
| **In Progress** | Variables being explored |
| **Open Conditions** | Unassigned variables |
| **Threats** | Constraint violations to resolve |
| **Unordered** | Variables with no ordering constraint between them |
| **Observations** | Learned constraints from failed attempts |

The partial-order structure of the plan is exactly the kind of structure CSP solvers are designed to work with: maintain flexibility (don't assign values until forced), propagate constraints (when one decision is made, prune the options for related decisions), and backtrack when a dead end is reached.
