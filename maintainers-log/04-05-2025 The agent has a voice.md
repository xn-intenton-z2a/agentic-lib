A Chat bot has been added with access to the repository source code and the ability to take some actions.
This chatbot uses GitHub Discussions right now but it will be the front end of intent√Øon.com allowing
anonymous users on the internet to interact with the repository.

First interactions with the bot:

https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/discussions/1217

And now captured when the repository is seeded:

- **Title**: seed test for feedback
- **URL**: https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/discussions/1220#discussioncomment-13030478
- **Created at**: 2025-05-04T14:02:55.040Z
