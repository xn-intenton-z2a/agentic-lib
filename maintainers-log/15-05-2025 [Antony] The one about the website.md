Over a year ago I became excited by the potential of using an LLM in with feedback while iterating over a code base and 
ultimately modifying itself (this repository). With that excitment came a juxtaposition of AGI this, a few scribbled
thats in my notebook and hours spent chaining together GitHub workflows to play the guess-a-number game. Empirical 
evidence notwithstanding, there was no time to waste in registering the domain name and commissioning artwork. Soon
it would be time to pick ice statues for the launch party and branding was necessary. 

I registered [intentïon.com](https://intentïon.com/) and commissioned a logo. Today the bot based interface is live on
on the website and users (who authenticate with GitHub) can interact with the repository. The bot is able to initiate
a repository seed on a topic of the user's choosing and answer questions about the repository. Next I need to showcase
the results and provide a way for users to create a repository from the seeded template and access archived experiments.

Some scribbled notes at attached alongside the same date as this entry. The scale of what I'm attempting has expanded
by an order of magnitude multiple times as the technology accelerated. First, a few bugs at a time scaled up to whole source files, then
whole repositories shipping with a personal AI (a term I only became aware of from Beacon 23). The flow to build an
audience has not changed. The self-developing repositories are the content, their progress is a stream of posts, and 
GitHub Actions Marketplace remains as the distribution channel. I need 100 users of the GitHub App before I can charge
for services and I prefer not to spend any money on marketing until there is an operating revenue stream.
