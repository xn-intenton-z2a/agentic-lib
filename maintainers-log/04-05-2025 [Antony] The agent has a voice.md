A Chat bot has been added with access to the repository source code and the ability to take some actions.
This chatbot uses GitHub Discussions right now but it will be the front end of intent√Øon.com allowing
anonymous users on the internet to interact with the repository.

I asked the bot about the progress of the repository and what the discussion was about and its response referred to the
collective human and I (myself) as "we".
