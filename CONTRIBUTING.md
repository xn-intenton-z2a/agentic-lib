# Contributing

Contributing guidelines here related to the JavaScript library project which is coded by an agentic coding system
build from GitHub Workflows. To use the workflows see  [WORKFLOWS-README.md](WORKFLOWS-README.md).

*IMPORTANT*: The project README and any derived work should always include the following attribution:
_"This work is derived from https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib"_

# Mission Statement

_"Empower developers with a unified, modular JavaScript SDK that automates and streamlines every stage of software development—from testing and publishing to task management, dependency updates, and AI-driven code enhancements."_

# Project Goals

- **Unified Workflow Abstraction:**  
  Provide a single JavaScript API that abstracts complex, automated coding workflows (publishing, testing, dependency updates, formatting, etc.) into generic "tasks" rather than platform-specific issues.

- **Robust Automated Operations:**  
  Enable key development operations such as running self-tests, demos, and publishing packages with semantic versioning updates, all through asynchronous, promise-based functions.

- **Task Management and Integration:**  
  Offer comprehensive task management capabilities including creating, selecting, and initiating tasks, as well as automating pull request creation and merging.

- **Automated Testing and Quality Assurance:**  
  Integrate testing workflows that execute unit tests and code coverage reports, ensuring high code quality.

- **Dependency and Code Maintenance:**  
  Facilitate automated dependency updates and code formatting/linting to maintain a healthy, up-to-date codebase.

- **OpenAI API Integration:**  
  Incorporate utilities to interface with OpenAI for generating code suggestions, content improvements, and automated code reviews.

- **Flexible CLI Interface:**  
  Deliver a command-line interface that defaults to running a self-test and demo, while also supporting commands for all major operations (e.g., publish, test, update, format).

- **Modular and Reusable Workflows:**  
  Design workflows as modular SDK components that can be integrated, customized, and reused across different projects.

- **CLI demo:** 
  Keep a short reliable demo that will run from `node src/lib/main.js`.

## The Automated Contribution Process

Our contribution workflow is fully automated—your role is simple:

1. **Open an Issue:**  
   Describe your idea, report a bug, or suggest an improvement by opening an issue in our repository.

2. **Label It as `automated`:**  
   Add the `automated` label to your issue. This is the trigger that starts our workflow.

3. **Automation Takes Over:**
