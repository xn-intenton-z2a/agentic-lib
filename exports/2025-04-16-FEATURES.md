# Feature: CLI and Lambda Utilities for Agentic Processing

This feature describes the behavior of a JavaScript-based command-line interface (CLI) and Lambda handlers that support logging, configuration, and command processing for an "agentic" system. The system includes utility functions for diagnostics, AWS SQS event handling, batch command processing, and CLI operation modes.

---

## Scenario: Environment Initialization

**Given** the application starts,

**Then** it:
- Loads environment variables from `.env` file or system environment.
- Uses defaults in test or development environments:
  - `GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` set to a test URL.
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` set to a test key.
- Validates the environment with a schema.

---

## Scenario: Logging Configuration

**Given** a log event occurs,

**Then** the system:
- Logs messages with ISO timestamps and severity level (`info` or `error`).
- Adds error stacks when verbose mode is enabled.
- Includes metadata for diagnostics and debugging.

---

## Scenario: SQS Digest Lambda Handler

**When** the `digestLambdaHandler` receives an SQS event,

**Then** it:
- Processes one or more records.
- Logs each digest received.
- Collects and returns failures if records have invalid JSON.
- Returns a structure with `batchItemFailures` for SQS partial failure retry.

---

## Scenario: Agentic Command Handler

**When** the `agenticHandler` processes a payload,

**Then**:
- **If** the payload has a `commands` array:
  - Validates the array structure.
  - Enforces a maximum batch size if `MAX_BATCH_COMMANDS` is set.
  - Logs and processes each command individually.
  - Returns a success object with timestamps and execution times.
- **If** the payload has a single `command`:
  - Validates it is a non-empty, actionable string.
  - Processes and logs the command.
  - Returns metadata including execution time.
- **If** invalid input is detected:
  - Logs an error and throws an exception.

---

## Scenario: CLI Argument Handling

**When** the script is run from the command line,

**Then** it supports the following flags:

| Flag              | Behavior                                                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--help`          | Prints a usage summary.                                                  |
| `--digest`        | Triggers the `digestLambdaHandler` with a sample SQS event.             |
| `--agentic <json>`| Processes a command payload using the `agenticHandler`.                 |
| `--version`       | Loads and displays version info from `package.json`.                    |
| `--verbose`       | Enables verbose logging globally.                                        |
| `--diagnostics`   | Logs detailed environment and runtime info.                              |
| `--status`        | Prints runtime health (config, node version, call count, uptime).        |
| `--dry-run`       | Does nothing; logs that no action was taken.                             |
| `--simulate-error`| Logs and throws a simulated fatal error, exiting with code 1.            |

---

## Scenario: Verbose and Diagnostic Mode

**When** verbose mode is active,

**Then**:
- All logs include a `verbose` flag.
- Full error stacks are printed.
- Diagnostics print environmental and version context.

---

## Scenario: Status Handler

**When** `statusHandler()` is called,

**Then** it returns:
- Current config values.
- Node.js version and uptime.
- Invocation `callCount`.
- Environment variables like `NODE_ENV` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

---

## Scenario: Error Simulation

**When** `--simulate-error` is provided,

**Then**:
- A simulated error is logged.
- The process exits with a failure code.

---

## Tags
- `@cli`
- `@lambda`
- `@agentic`

# RETRY_HANDLER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a simple retry mechanism into the agentic command processing workflow. When enabled via an environment variable `AGENTIC_RETRIES`, the library will automatically retry command execution upon transient failures before ultimately failing. This increases the robustness and resiliency of the agentic-lib, especially when facing intermittent errors in command processing.

## Implementation Details
### Source File Modifications (src/lib/main.js)
- **Command Retry Logic:**
  - In the `agenticHandler` function, wrap the single command processing block (and optionally batch processing) in a retry loop.
  - Read the environment variable `AGENTIC_RETRIES` and parse it as an integer indicating the maximum number of attempts (defaulting to 1 if not set).
  - For each command, attempt processing. If an error occurs that qualifies as a transient error (for example, simulated by a specific command input such as "forceRetry" or any error generated during processing), catch the error and retry until the maximum number of attempts is reached.
  - Log each retry attempt using the existing `logInfo` and `logError` functions. Use verbose logging if enabled.
  
### Testing Enhancements (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **New Test Cases for Retry Mechanism:**
  - Add tests that simulate transient failures in the `agenticHandler`. For instance, when a command string "forceRetry" is provided, the first attempt fails and a subsequent retry succeeds.
  - Verify that the global invocation counter (`globalThis.callCount`) is incremented only after a successful processing.
  - Include negative tests to ensure that if all retry attempts fail, the final error is thrown and logged appropriately.

### Documentation Updates (README.md)
- **Usage Section Update:**
  - Document the new `AGENTIC_RETRIES` environment variable. Explain that setting this variable to a positive integer enables automatic retries for command processing.
  - Provide usage examples showing how to set `AGENTIC_RETRIES` (e.g., `AGENTIC_RETRIES=3`) and describe scenarios where this mechanism adds value, such as handling intermittent errors.

## Benefits & Success Criteria
- **Improved Resiliency:** Automatically retries transient failures, reducing the need for manual intervention during intermittent error conditions.
- **Enhanced Robustness:** The system becomes less brittle in the face of temporary issues, contributing to a smoother user experience.
- **Testability:** New tests ensure that the retry mechanism behaves as expected and that it does not interfere with the primary command processing functionality.

## Verification & Acceptance
- The `agenticHandler` should retry processing a command up to the number of attempts specified by `AGENTIC_RETRIES` when a transient error occurs.
- Successful retry attempts should lead to normal command completions with the retry count logged.
- If all retry attempts fail, the final error should be logged and thrown as per existing error-handling behavior.
- All new tests added for this feature must pass without affecting current functionalities.
features/rejects/METRICS_EXPORT.md
==== Content of features/rejects/METRICS_EXPORT.md ====
# METRICS_EXPORT Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI flag `--metrics` that aggregates and exports performance and usage metrics collected during the runtime of the agentic-lib. By providing insights such as the total number of commands processed and the average execution time for commands, this feature enhances observability and helps diagnose performance variations or potential bottlenecks.

## Implementation Details
### Source File Modifications (src/lib/main.js)
- **New Metrics Aggregator Function:**
  - Implement a function `exportMetrics` which computes and logs aggregated metrics (e.g., total calls via `globalThis.callCount` and average `executionTimeMS` from recent executions).
  - Store execution times in an array (e.g., `globalThis.executionTimes`) updated after each command in `agenticHandler`.
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Add a new CLI flag `--metrics` in the `main` function. When provided, the program should call `exportMetrics` to output the collected metrics to the console.
  - Ensure that this flag does not interfere with other functionalities such as `--status` or `--verbose`.

### Testing Enhancements (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **New Test Cases for Metrics Export:**
  - Add test cases to simulate command processing and then invoke the CLI with the `--metrics` flag to verify that the metrics output includes the total number of processed commands and average execution times in a formatted message.
  - Ensure that the metrics output does not disrupt normal operation and that other CLI flags remain functional.

### Documentation Updates (README.md)
- **Usage Section Update:**
  - Update the CLI usage instructions to include the `--metrics` flag.
  - Provide example commands that demonstrate how to invoke the metrics export and explain the meaning of the reported metrics (e.g., total invocation count and average execution time per command).

## Benefits & Success Criteria
- **Enhanced Observability:** Provides immediate feedback on runtime performance and usage, assisting developers in monitoring system behavior under load.
- **Non-intrusive:** Integrates seamlessly with the existing CLI without affecting other available commands or features.
- **Testable:** Unit tests and CLI simulations cover the new functionality to ensure metrics are accurately reported.

## Verification & Acceptance
- When the `--metrics` flag is used, the CLI should output a clear message that includes aggregated metrics such as the total call count and average execution time computed from recent commands.
- Automated tests should cover both the metrics export functionality and its integration with the other CLI commands without regression.

features/rejects/COMMAND_ALIAS.md
==== Content of features/rejects/COMMAND_ALIAS.md ====
# COMMAND_ALIAS Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces support for command aliases in the agentic-lib CLI. Users can define aliases for frequently used commands via the environment variable `AGENTIC_ALIAS`. The variable is expected to contain a JSON mapping of alias names to the actual commands. This simplifies command input, reduces potential errors, and enhances the overall user experience.

## Implementation Details
### Source File Modifications (src/lib/main.js)
- **Alias Resolution:** At the start of the CLI processing, parse the `AGENTIC_ALIAS` environment variable (if set) as a JSON object mapping alias keys to actual command strings.
- **Command Substitution:** Before passing the command to the `agenticHandler`, check if the provided command (or any command in a batch) exists in the alias map. If an alias is found, substitute it with the corresponding actual command.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure that both single command and batch command scenarios support alias substitution without interfering with existing validations. Maintain current logging and error handling behavior, and add verbose logs for alias substitutions when `--verbose` is activated.

### Testing Enhancements (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **New Test Cases for Alias Resolution:** Add unit tests that set the `AGENTIC_ALIAS` environment variable to a valid JSON mapping. Test that providing an alias via the `--agentic` flag results in the actual command being processed.
- **Batch Processing:** Verify that each command in a batch payload is independently checked and substituted if an alias is defined.
- **Fallback Behavior:** Confirm that if an alias is not defined, the original command is processed unchanged.

### Documentation Updates (README.md)
- **CLI Usage Section Update:** Document the new alias functionality. Explain how to define the `AGENTIC_ALIAS` environment variable with a JSON mapping and provide examples of invoking commands using an alias.
- **Usage Examples:** Include example commands showing how using an alias simplifies the command input.

- **Enhanced User Experience:** The alias resolution provides a more flexible CLI by allowing customization without code changes.
- **Testable and Stable:** The functionality is covered by unit tests and documented, ensuring reliability and ease of future maintenance.

## Verification & Acceptance
- The CLI should resolve an alias to its actual command both in single and batch processing scenarios.
- Logs should indicate alias substitution when `--verbose` mode is enabled.
- Unit tests must confirm that alias resolution works correctly and that non-alias commands are processed normally.features/rejects/EXEC_TIMINGS.md
==== Content of features/rejects/EXEC_TIMINGS.md ====
# EXEC_TIMINGS Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI flag `--timings` to measure and output the execution time of the commands processed by the agentic-lib. By wrapping the command execution flow with a timer, users will receive a report of how long the operation took, enhancing observability and performance troubleshooting without altering any core functionalities.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Modifications (src/lib/main.js)
- **Timer Integration:**
  - Modify the `main` function to check if the `--timings` flag is present in the command arguments.
  - If present, capture the start time before processing any command.
  - After processing the command(s) (including CLI flags like `--agentic`, `--digest`, etc.), compute the elapsed time and print it to the console using a formatted message (e.g., "Execution time: X ms").
  - Ensure that all branches (like `--help`, `--version`, etc.) include timing calculation where appropriate without interfering with their original behavior.

### Testing Enhancements (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **New Test Cases for Execution Timings:**
  - Add test cases that invoke the CLI with the `--timings` flag along with another valid flag (such as `--dry-run` or `--status`).
  - Verify that the console output includes a message indicating the execution time (e.g., matches a regex like /Execution time: \d+ ms/).
  - Ensure that the addition of timings does not break existing CLI functionalities.

==== Content of features/APPLY_FIX.md ====
# APPLY_FIX Feature Specification

This feature describes the behavior of a GitHub Actions workflow that applies automated code, test, README, and dependency fixes based on outputs from build, test, and run validations. The workflow uses OpenAI's API to propose and apply changes. The following behaviors are expected:

## Scenario: Prepare and Load Inputs

**Given** the workflow is triggered with inputs such as:
- paths to key project files (`src/lib/main.js`, `README.md`, `package.json`, etc.),
- scripts to build, test, and run the application,
- and a secret API key for OpenAI,

**Then** the workflow:
- Checks out the specified branch,
- Configures Node.js and caching (if needed),
- Optionally authenticates with GitHub’s NPM registry,
- Lists existing features from the designated features directory.

## Scenario: Gather Build Context

**Given** the repository and environment are prepared,

**When** the workflow runs:

- It installs project dependencies,
- Executes the build script,
- Runs test scripts,
- Executes the main script with a timeout.

**Then** the outputs of each step are captured and saved for later context.

## Scenario: Generate Fix Proposal Using LLM

**Given** the outputs from install, build, test, and run are available,

**When** the workflow invokes the `update-target` step,

**Then** it:
- Loads contents of source files (`main.js`, test file, README, etc.),
- Assembles a prompt with all relevant project context (existing features, file contents, command outputs),
- Sends the prompt to OpenAI with a functional call schema requesting updated versions of:
  - Source file,
  - Test file,
  - README file,
  - Dependencies file.

**Then** the model responds with a structured JSON containing:
- Updated versions of the four files,
- A message suitable for use as a commit message.

## Scenario: Apply Proposed Fixes

**Given** the LLM returns updated content,

**When** the content differs from current file versions,

**Then** the workflow:
- Overwrites the respective files (`main.js`, test file, README, package.json) with the updated content,
- Logs file update status and lengths.

**If** the LLM response is invalid or missing,
- The workflow fails with an appropriate message.

## Scenario: Validate Fix Locally

**Given** updated files have been written,

**Then** the workflow:
- Re-installs dependencies (`npm install`),
- Runs CI install (`npm ci`),
- Runs the test script again,
- Runs the main script again (with timeout).

Each of these validation steps is monitored for success or failure.

## Scenario: Commit Changes

**Given** one or more files were updated,

**Then** the workflow:
- Stages and commits the changes with the sanitized commit message from the LLM,
- Pushes the branch to origin.

## Scenario: Finalize and Report

**When** all steps have completed,

**Then** the workflow:
- Summarizes outcomes of each validation step (install, CI, test, main, commit),
- Exposes output flags indicating:
  - Whether a fix was applied,
  - The commit message,
  - Success/failure of post-fix validations,
  - Whether *all* validations succeeded.

# WORKFLOW_CHAIN Feature Specification

This feature describes the interaction between the library, sources, and publish web workflows, creating a continuous chain from source material to published web content. The workflows work together to maintain and publish feature documentation, with potential extensions for OWL semantic markup, visible and metadata attributions, and document traceability.

## Scenario: Source Material Collection

**Given** the source worker workflow is triggered,

**Then** it:
- Maintains the `SOURCES.md` file with URLs and metadata
- Updates source entries with new URLs and metadata
- Validates source entries for proper formatting
- Ensures sources have appropriate licensing information

## Scenario: Library Document Generation

**Given** the library worker workflow is triggered,

**When** source entries are available in `SOURCES.md`,

**Then** it:
- Crawls URLs from source entries to gather content
- Generates document summaries using AI
- Creates or updates feature documents in the features directory
- Manages document lifecycle (creation, updates, deletion)
- Handles timeouts gracefully for build, test, and main scripts

## Scenario: Web Content Publication

**Given** the publish web workflow is triggered,

**When** feature documents exist in the features directory,

**Then** it:
- Converts markdown feature files to HTML
- Generates an index page with links to all features
- Deploys to GitHub Pages for public access
- Makes the content available at a published URL

## Scenario: Workflow Chain Interaction

**Given** all three workflows are configured in the repository,

**Then** they interact in the following way:
1. The Source Worker maintains the `SOURCES.md` file with URLs and metadata
2. The Library Worker uses the sources to create/update feature documents in the features directory
3. The Publish Web workflow converts these feature documents to HTML and publishes them to GitHub Pages

## Scenario: OWL Semantic Markup Extension

**Given** the feature chain is operational,

**When** OWL semantic markup extensions are implemented,

**Then** the published HTML is enhanced with:
- RDFa attributes in the HTML templates
- Semantic relationships between features using OWL properties
- Feature classes and properties defined in an ontology file
- Machine-readable metadata that enables advanced search and reasoning

## Scenario: Document Traceability Implementation

**Given** the feature chain with OWL extensions is operational,

**Then** document traceability is implemented through:
- Provenance information using OWL properties
- Links between features and their source material with semantic relationships
- Version history and change tracking metadata
- Clear attribution chains from source to published content

## Scenario: Visible and Metadata Attributions

**Given** the feature chain with OWL extensions is operational,

**Then** attributions are implemented as:
- Visible attribution sections in the HTML
- Machine-readable attribution metadata using RDFa
- Links to license information with semantic properties
- Clear citation of original sources and modifications
