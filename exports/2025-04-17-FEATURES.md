# RETRY_HANDLER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a simple retry mechanism into the agentic command processing workflow. When enabled via an environment variable `AGENTIC_RETRIES`, the library will automatically retry command execution upon transient failures before ultimately failing. This increases the robustness and resiliency of the agentic-lib, especially when facing intermittent errors in command processing.

## Implementation Details
### Source File Modifications (src/lib/main.js)
- **Command Retry Logic:**
  - In the `agenticHandler` function, wrap the single command processing block (and optionally batch processing) in a retry loop.
  - Read the environment variable `AGENTIC_RETRIES` and parse it as an integer indicating the maximum number of attempts (defaulting to 1 if not set).
  - For each command, attempt processing. If an error occurs that qualifies as a transient error (for example, simulated by a specific command input such as "forceRetry" or any error generated during processing), catch the error and retry until the maximum number of attempts is reached.
  - Log each retry attempt using the existing `logInfo` and `logError` functions. Use verbose logging if enabled.
  
### Testing Enhancements (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **New Test Cases for Retry Mechanism:**
  - Add tests that simulate transient failures in the `agenticHandler`. For instance, when a command string "forceRetry" is provided, the first attempt fails and a subsequent retry succeeds.
  - Verify that the global invocation counter (`globalThis.callCount`) is incremented only after a successful processing.
  - Include negative tests to ensure that if all retry attempts fail, the final error is thrown and logged appropriately.

### Documentation Updates (README.md)
- **Usage Section Update:**
  - Document the new `AGENTIC_RETRIES` environment variable. Explain that setting this variable to a positive integer enables automatic retries for command processing.
  - Provide usage examples showing how to set `AGENTIC_RETRIES` (e.g., `AGENTIC_RETRIES=3`) and describe scenarios where this mechanism adds value, such as handling intermittent errors.

## Benefits & Success Criteria
- **Improved Resiliency:** Automatically retries transient failures, reducing the need for manual intervention during intermittent error conditions.
- **Enhanced Robustness:** The system becomes less brittle in the face of temporary issues, contributing to a smoother user experience.
- **Testability:** New tests ensure that the retry mechanism behaves as expected and that it does not interfere with the primary command processing functionality.

## Verification & Acceptance
- The `agenticHandler` should retry processing a command up to the number of attempts specified by `AGENTIC_RETRIES` when a transient error occurs.
- Successful retry attempts should lead to normal command completions with the retry count logged.
- If all retry attempts fail, the final error should be logged and thrown as per existing error-handling behavior.
- All new tests added for this feature must pass without affecting current functionalities.

# CLI_UTILS Feature Specification

This feature consolidates and upgrades the command line interface functionalities of the repository. It merges the previously separate APPLY_FIX and AGENT_CLI features into a unified CLI utility that supports agentic command processing, automated fix application, simulation of errors and delays, diagnostics, status reporting, and version output. 

## Objectives

- Provide a single CLI entry point for processing agentic commands (both single and batch modes).
- Enable automated code, test, README, and dependency fixes via the --apply-fix flag.
- Enhance observability with detailed logging, diagnostics (--diagnostics) and runtime health reports (--status).
- Support additional CLI behaviors such as simulating errors (--simulate-error), delaying execution (--simulate-delay), and dry-run mode (--dry-run).
- Maintain clear and informative usage output (--help) and proper version reporting (--version).

## User Scenarios

**Scenario: Agentic Command Processing**

- When a user invokes the CLI with the --agentic flag and a valid JSON payload with a single command or an array of commands, the system validates and processes the commands sequentially.
- Each valid command is logged with its execution time (executionTimeMS) and the global invocation counter is incremented.

**Scenario: Automated Fix Application**

- When the CLI is invoked with the --apply-fix flag, the system applies pre-defined automated fixes to source, test, README, and dependency files.
- A success message "Applied fix successfully" is logged to indicate completion.

**Scenario: Simulation and Diagnostics**

- When the --simulate-error flag is provided, the system logs a simulated error and exits with a non-zero exit code, aiding in testing error handling.
- When the --simulate-delay flag is used with a specified delay in milliseconds, execution is deferred appropriately to simulate processing latency.
- The --diagnostics flag outputs an in-depth report detailing configuration, Node.js version, environment variables, and other runtime data.

**Scenario: Informational Commands**

- The --version flag outputs current version information along with a timestamp, extracted from package.json.
- The --status flag provides a JSON summary of runtime health including configuration, invocation count, and uptime.
- The --dry-run flag allows a no-side-effect execution mode, confirming action without performing any operations.

## Success Criteria

- Correct merging of functionalities with detailed logging and error handling.
- Comprehensive test coverage ensuring that each CLI flag returns expected outputs.
- Consistent and clear output messages across all CLI commands.
- Full integration with existing workflows without disrupting the Workflow Chain feature.

## Dependencies & Constraints

- This feature is implemented solely by modifying existing source, test, README, and dependency files.
- It adheres to Node 20+ requirements and ECMAScript module standards.
- No new files are added, and legacy features APPLY_FIX and AGENT_CLI are merged into this new unified CLI utility.

## Verification & Acceptance

- Automated tests should cover all CLI flags including edge cases (e.g., invalid JSON, empty commands, commands equivalent to "NaN").
- Manual testing should confirm that the CLI displays usage, version, diagnostics, and proper error messages.
- Code reviews ensure adherence to the contributing guidelines and synchronization with updated documentation in README.md.
