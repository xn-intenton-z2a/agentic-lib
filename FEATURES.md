## Product

### What it is

A clonable GitHub template that turns a mission statement into working, tested, deployed code — autonomously, using GitHub Copilot as the only AI engine. You write what you want in plain English. The system derives features, creates issues, writes code, runs tests, merges PRs, and closes issues — in a continuous loop.

**Target audience:** Any developer with a GitHub Copilot subscription who wants to describe what they want and watch it build itself.

**Tagline:** _"What is your intentïon?"_

### What makes this unique (February 2026)

1. **Mission-driven**: Plain English → features → issues → code → PR → merge → close, in a continuous loop
2. **Self-healing**: Failures trigger fixes, stalls trigger reseeds, completed features trigger pruning
3. **Transparent**: Every action logged in intentïon.md with commit links, token usage, and outcomes
4. **Community-interactive**: Discussions bot bridges human intent to autonomous action
5. **Zero vendor lock-in**: GitHub Actions + GitHub Copilot only. You own everything.
6. **Clone and go**: Create from template, write a mission, enable Copilot. That's it.
7. **TDD by default**: Features start with failing tests — the AI writes tests first

### Why someone would clone this

- **Solo developers** who want continuous progress on side projects without daily effort
- **Teams** wanting an autonomous maintenance/improvement agent for existing repos
- **Educators** teaching autonomous systems, DevOps, or AI-assisted development
- **Open source maintainers** who want an AI contributor that follows their mission

## Features

### Core Features (#1-17)

#### 1. Autonomous Code Transformation

The core proposition: repositories transform their own code through an AI-driven feedback loop. Converts a mission statement into working, tested, deployed code through a chain of automated transformations. The `agentic-step` action with the `transform` task replaces the previous 10-workflow transformation chain with 3 orchestration workflows: `agent-flow-transform.yml`, `agent-flow-maintain.yml`, `agent-flow-review.yml`.

**Pipeline:** Mission → Sources → Library → Features → Issues → Code → PR → Merge → Close
**Repositories:** agentic-lib (workflows), repository0 (consumer)
**Status:** Done

#### 2. Issue Lifecycle Management

Automated creation, enhancement, assignment, resolution, and closure of GitHub issues. Issues progress through: Created → Enhanced (ready label) → In-progress → Code generated → PR created → Merged → Closed. The `agentic-step` action orchestrates the lifecycle with WIP limits (2 feature, 1 maintenance) and attempt tracking.

**Labels:** `automated`, `ready`, `in-progress`, `feature`, `maintenance`, `automerge`
**Repositories:** agentic-lib (workflows), repository0 (consumer)
**Status:** Done

#### 3. Feature Lifecycle Management

Maintains feature specification files (markdown) in `.github/agentic-lib/features/`. Features are created from library analysis, refined, used to generate issues, and pruned when complete. The `maintain-features` task in `agentic-step` handles all lifecycle operations.

**Limits:** Max 4-8 features at a time (configurable)
**Repositories:** agentic-lib (workflows + sandbox features), repository0 (consumer features)
**Status:** Done

#### 4. Code Generation & Fixing

Given an issue or a failing test, generates code changes, validates they pass tests, and creates a PR. Also fixes failing PRs by analyzing test output. Two task handlers: `resolve-issue` (issue → code → PR) and `fix-code` (fix failing tests).

**Agent prompts:** `agent-issue-resolution.md`, `agent-apply-fix.md`
**Repositories:** agentic-lib (workflows), repository0 (consumer)
**Status:** Done

#### 5. Auto-Merge & Branch Management

Monitors PRs with the `automerge` label. When all checks pass, merges the PR. Handles branch conflicts by closing conflicted PRs. Extended to also match `copilot/*` branches.

**Key workflow:** `ci-automerge.yml`
**Repositories:** agentic-lib (workflow), repository0 (consumer)
**Status:** Done

#### 6. Discussions Bot

AI agent that responds to GitHub Discussions, creates features, seeds repositories, and provides status updates. The `discussions` task in `agentic-step` uses the Copilot SDK for conversational responses with tool-use capability for reading files and posting responses.

**Actions:** `seed-repository`, `create-feature`, `create-issue`, `nop`, `mission-complete`, `stop`
**Key workflow:** `agent-discussions-bot.yml`
**Status:** Done

#### 7. Statistics & Observability

Collects repository statistics (branches, PRs, issues, commits), publishes as JSON to S3, renders on a web dashboard (`public/all.html`), and maintains an activity log (`intentïon.md`). Copilot SDK usage metrics replace OpenAI token tracking. Statistics publishing is now handled by the `ci-automerge.yml` log job.

**AWS targets:** `s3://agentic-lib-telemetry-bucket/events/`, `s3://agentic-lib-public-website-stats-bucket/`
**Key workflow:** `ci-automerge.yml` (log-intention-activity-merge-pr job)
**Status:** Done

#### 8. Publishing Pipeline

Publishes npm packages with OIDC trusted publishing (no tokens). The npm package includes the `agentic-step` action and all distributed content. Published to npmjs.org with provenance attestation.

**npm package:** `@xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib`
**Key workflow:** `release.yml`
**Status:** Done

#### 9. Website & Brand

Minimalist single-page website at xn--intenton-z2a.com. Dark text on foggy background with animated fog layers. Giscus integration for community interaction. Brand assets in multiple formats.

**Repository:** xn--intenton-z2a.com
**Status:** Done

#### 10. AWS Infrastructure — agentic-lib

S3 buckets (telemetry + public website), SQS queues, Lambda function (Docker-based digest processor), DynamoDB projections table, CloudTrail logging, and IAM roles for GitHub Actions. CDK stacks in Java.

**Key resources:** `agentic-lib-telemetry-bucket`, `agentic-lib-public-website-stats-bucket`, `agentic-lib-digest-queue`
**Repository:** agentic-lib
**Status:** Done

#### 11. AWS Infrastructure — Website

CloudFront + S3 hosting with SSL, Route53 DNS, CloudTrail telemetry, and access log forwarding via Lambda. CDK stacks: NetworkStack, ApplicationStack, TelemetryStack.

**Repository:** xn--intenton-z2a.com
**Status:** Done

#### 12. CI/CD & Code Quality

Tests on push/PR (Vitest), linting (ESLint), auto-merge of passing PRs. `copilot-setup-steps.yml` enables Copilot coding agent to run tests.

**Key workflows:** `test.yml`, `ci-automerge.yml`
**Status:** Done

#### 13. Configuration & Safety

Centralises agent parameters in `agentic-lib.yml`: file paths with read/write permissions, build/test/main scripts, WIP limits, attempt limits, sandbox reset behaviour, seed files, schedule selection. The `config-loader.js` and `safety.js` modules enforce limits.

**Config file:** `.github/agentic-lib/agents/agentic-lib.yml`
**Status:** Done

#### 14. Template System

repository0 serves as a clonable GitHub template pre-configured with all agentic workflows, agent configs, seeds, and a getting-started guide. Simplified from 31 workflows to 9 (8 distributed + 1 local init). Users write `MISSION.md` and enable Copilot — no OpenAI key needed.

**Repository:** repository0
**Status:** Done

#### 15. Library & Knowledge Management

Crawls URLs in SOURCES.md, extracts technical content, creates/updates library documents in `library/`, and generates a searchable HTML index. The `maintain-library` task in `agentic-step` handles all operations.

**Limits:** 8-16 source entries, 32-64 library documents (configurable)
**Status:** Done

#### 16. Maintenance & Hygiene

Handles repository hygiene: sweeps stale branches, recovers stuck issues, reseeds stale repositories. The `init.yml` workflow (maintained locally by each consumer) keeps infrastructure up to date. Reseed logic configured via `agentic-lib.yml`.

**Key workflow:** `init.yml` (consumer-maintained, not distributed)
**Status:** Done

#### 17. Scripts & Utilities

7 utility scripts distributed to consumers for release acceptance, schedule activation, cleanup, initialisation, HTML generation, and dependency updates. Additional development scripts remain in the agentic-lib repo only.

**Distributed scripts:** `accept-release.sh`, `activate-schedule.sh`, `clean.sh`, `initialise.sh`, `md-to-html.js`, `update.sh`
**Repository:** agentic-lib
**Status:** Done

### MVP Features (#18-25)

#### 18. Copilot Migration

Port from OpenAI API to GitHub Copilot SDK. The `agentic-step` action wraps the SDK and supports 8 task types: `resolve-issue`, `fix-code`, `transform`, `maintain-features`, `maintain-library`, `enhance-issue`, `review-issue`, `discussions`.

**Key deliverable:** `.github/agentic-lib/actions/agentic-step/`
**Status:** Done

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] `agentic-step` action authenticates with Copilot SDK and returns output
- [ ] All 8 task handlers produce equivalent outcomes to the OpenAI-based workflows
- [ ] No `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` or `openai` package anywhere in the codebase
- [ ] Action published to GitHub Marketplace as `@xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-step`

#### 19. Workflow Hardening (Critical Subset)

7 critical hardening items: traceability (commit URLs in logs), safety (check-before-act), debuggability (log outcomes), and deduplication. Implemented across `logging.js`, `safety.js`, `config-loader.js`, and task handlers.

**Items:** 2.1 (commit URLs), 2.2 (log outcomes), 2.4 (nop for resolved), 2.8 (context in comments), 2.15 (path separation), 2.17 (reusable patterns), 2.25 (check before generate)
**Status:** Done

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] intentïon.md entries include commit URLs
- [ ] Attempt check outcomes are logged
- [ ] Resolved issues return nop without generating code
- [ ] Issue comments include context about what happened
- [ ] Writable/non-writable paths are separated in agent prompts

#### 20. Discussions Bot Intelligence

Extends the bot with proactive feature management and mission protection. The bot can create, update, and delete features, and pushes back on mission-violating requests. Uses `[ACTION:create-feature]` and `[ACTION:nop]` patterns.

**Items:** 3.3 (bot manages features), 3.4 (bot protects mission)
**Status:** Done

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Bot creates features when requested via Discussion
- [ ] Bot declines requests that violate the mission with an explanation
- [ ] Bot can delete/update existing features through Discussion interaction

#### 21. Onboarding Experience

The critical path from discovery to running autonomous development. Includes `demo.sh` (automated demo), `DEMO.md` (expected output), `GETTING-STARTED.md` (3-step Copilot setup), and pristine template state.

**Items:** 4.1 (scripted setup), 4.8 (automated demo), 4.10 ("Hello World!" initial state), 4.11 (clean template)
**Status:** Done

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] `demo.sh` runs end-to-end without manual intervention
- [ ] GETTING-STARTED.md describes 3-step Copilot setup (no OpenAI key)
- [ ] repository0 initial state produces "Hello World!" output
- [ ] No experiment debris in repository0 template

#### 22. Supervisor (Reactive Orchestration)

`agent-supervisor.yml` — triggered by `workflow_run` completion events. Checks if workflows failed on agentic/copilot branches → dispatches `fix-code`. Checks for stale issues → dispatches `review`.

**Status:** Done

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Build failure on agentic branch triggers fix-code within 5 minutes
- [ ] Stale issues trigger review automatically
- [ ] Supervisor does not create infinite dispatch loops

#### 23. TDD Workflow

Feature development that starts with a failing test. The `transform` task in TDD mode: (1) creates test capturing the feature requirement, (2) commits it (test fails), (3) writes implementation to make test pass, (4) PR contains both test and implementation.

**Status:** Done

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Transform task in TDD mode creates a failing test first
- [ ] Second step makes the test pass
- [ ] PR contains both test and implementation
- [ ] Non-TDD mode still works as before

#### 24. Showcase Page

A page on xn--intenton-z2a.com showing live experiment status from stats JSON on S3. Displays past successful transformations with links to repositories, PRs, and activity logs.

**Repository:** xn--intenton-z2a.com
**Status:** Done

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Showcase page loads and renders experiment data
- [ ] At least 2 experiments displayed with stats
- [ ] Links to repositories, PRs, and activity logs work
- [ ] Page is accessible from the main website navigation

#### 25. Submission Box

"What is your intentïon?" submission box on the website. Creates a GitHub Discussion via Giscus, which the discussions bot picks up and processes. Includes terms, pronunciation guide, and brand tagline.

**Repository:** xn--intenton-z2a.com
**Status:** Done

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Submission box renders on the website
- [ ] Submitting creates a GitHub Discussion
- [ ] Terms and conditions are displayed and must be accepted
- [ ] Discussions bot processes the submission

### Completion Features (#26-27)

#### 26. Verification & Testing

Integration testing to prove the system works end-to-end against real infrastructure.

| Aspect           | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it does** | Tests the agentic-step action against the real Copilot SDK. System tests (`system-test.sh`) run full init→maintain-features→transform flows. Local SDK test (`test-copilot-local.js`) verifies auth, models, sessions, and tool use. Live transform workflow verified in repository0. |
| **Repositories** | agentic-lib, repository0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Why now**      | Verified against real infrastructure — transform workflow runs end-to-end in repository0.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

**Status:** Done

#### 27. Code Reduction & Optimization

Make the MVP compact and information-dense — fewer files, less redundancy, easier to understand.

| Aspect           | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it does** | Inlined all 11 single-caller `wfr-*` files into their parent workflows and deleted them. Consolidated redundant workflows. Removed dead code paths. Reduced from 99 to 20 total workflows (-80%). |
| **Repositories** | agentic-lib, repository0                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Why now**      | MVP should be lean. Every unnecessary file is cognitive overhead for new users who clone the template.                                                                                                           |

**Status:** Done

## Critical Success Criteria

### 1. The Demo Works

**One impressive, public, end-to-end demo running.**

A real repository that started from a 3-sentence mission and transformed into a working, tested, published package — with the full intentïon.md audit trail visible. Must be reproducible (`demo.sh`), impressive (working CLI tool or library, not just "Hello World"), transparent (every decision logged), and recordable (2-minute video).

**Test:** "Would a developer share this on social media after watching it?"

### 2. The Loop Closes

**The full autonomous cycle completes without human intervention.**

Mission → Features → Issues → Code → Tests pass → PR → Auto-merge → Issue closed. When tests fail, fix-code kicks in. When features stall, the system prunes. Self-sustaining — not just one pass but a continuous cycle.

**Test:** "Can I write a mission, walk away for 48 hours, and come back to merged PRs with passing tests?"

### 3. Anyone Can Clone It

**A stranger can go from discovery to running autonomous development in under 10 minutes.**

No prior knowledge. No OpenAI API key. No AWS setup. Just: create from template, write a mission, enable Copilot, wait.

**Test:** "Can someone who found this via a Hacker News link get their own repo transforming before they lose interest?"

### Decision filter

For any feature, bug fix, or architectural decision, ask:

1. Does this make the demo more impressive?
2. Does this help the loop close more reliably?
3. Does this make it easier for a stranger to clone and run?

If the answer to all three is "no," it's post-MVP work.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Getting Traction

**Three audiences, three framings:**

| Audience                          | Pitch                                                                                                                            | Distribution                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Solo devs / side-project builders | "Set it and forget it. Write what you want, come back tomorrow to a PR."                                                         | Show HN, Reddit r/programming, dev Twitter/Bluesky              |
| Teams / open source maintainers   | "An AI contributor that handles dependency updates, linting fixes, and feature requests from Discussions — you just review PRs." | Dev advocacy, conference talks, blog posts                      |
| Microsoft / GitHub                | "This is the most advanced Copilot SDK integration in the wild."                                                                 | GitHub Universe talk, GitHub Stars program, Marketplace listing |

**Launch moves (priority order):**

1. **The demo** — single most important marketing asset
2. **GitHub Marketplace listing** for `agentic-step`
3. **Blog post**: "I let AI transform my code for 30 days. Here's what happened."
4. **Show HN** with blog post and live showcase
5. **Showcase page** on xn--intenton-z2a.com with live stats

### Getting Microsoft's Attention

intentïon is one of the first projects to build a full autonomous development loop on GitHub's own infrastructure using the Copilot SDK. Realistic paths: GitHub Universe talk, GitHub Stars program, Marketplace featured listing, Copilot SDK feedback, build in public.

### Revenue Streams (Post-Launch)

The MVP is pre-revenue. Revenue follows attention.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Done)

Build the `agentic-step` action and prove it works for a single task. Scaffold action, implement `resolve-issue` and `fix-code` tasks, add `copilot-setup-steps.yml`, update `ci-automerge.yml` for `copilot/*` branches, implement `config-loader.js` + `safety.js`.

### Phase 2: Full Pipeline (Done)

Port all LLM tasks to `agentic-step`. Implement all 8 task handlers (`transform`, `maintain-features`, `maintain-library`, `enhance-issue`, `review-issue`, `discussions`), logging.js, and the simplified workflow set (2 agentic-lib + 9 repository0).

### Phase 3: Hardening (Done)

Make it reliable and safe. Implement workflow hardening items, discussions bot intelligence, supervisor workflow, TDD mode, test suite (236 tests across 21 files), CI pipeline, and integration test structure.

### Phase 4: Template & Launch (Done)

Clean repository0 to pristine template state. Write `demo.sh` + `DEMO.md`, update getting-started guide, update READMEs, write API.md, implement website updates (tagline, submission box, showcase page). Structural reorganisation to `.github/agentic-lib/` namespace.
