Bring test coverage up to cover any likley paths and failure scenarios, have single layer mocked tests and deeper tests mocking at the external resource (e.g. file system or network).

- Dry-run any examples in comments or the README against the current code and if they are not accurate or if they could cover more features, update the docs or code to be accurate.
