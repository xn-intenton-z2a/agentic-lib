# PLAN_LAUNCH.md — Launch Strategy for intentïon agentic-lib

## Market Position

intentïon occupies a unique position at the intersection of three converging trends: autonomous coding agents going mainstream, agentic AI reshaping engineering workflows, and recursive self-improvement moving from theory to practice.

### Where the industry is (March 2026)

AI coding agents have moved from research demos to production tools. [Agentic coding in 2026](https://www.timesofai.com/industry-insights/agentic-coding-in-software-development/) is predicted to move toward fully automated software engineering environments operating without much human supervision throughout an entire product life cycle. [PwC's Agentic SDLC report](https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/2026/docs/future-of-solutions-dev-and-delivery-in-the-rise-of-gen-ai.pdf) envisions AI as a first-pass executor across the SDLC, compressing weeks of coordination into continuous workflows.

Meanwhile, recursive self-improvement is the hottest open problem in AI. The [ICLR 2026 Workshop on AI with Recursive Self-Improvement](https://recursive-workshop.github.io/) notes that "loops that rewrite prompts, weights, or hypotheses already operate inside foundation-model pipelines and embodied agents, yet their behavior remains poorly characterized, and evaluation, safety, and governance tools lag behind algorithmic progress." [Apart Research](https://apartresearch.com/project/the-hidden-threat-of-recursive-selfimproving-llms-x5f0) has flagged this as an active safety concern.

### Where intentïon fits

No existing product combines all three: a continuous autonomous development loop, a formal planning theory, and self-hosting capability. intentïon is building at the convergence.

| Capability | intentïon | [Copilot Coding Agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent) | [Devin 2.0](https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/devin-2-0-is-here-cognition-slashes-price-of-ai-software-engineer-to-20-per-month-from-500) | [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) / Claude Code |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Continuous autonomous loop | Yes — mission → features → issues → code → merge → repeat | No — single task per assignment | No — single session | No — human in loop |
| Persistent planning artifact | Yes — partial-order plan committed to repo, refined each cycle | No | No — ephemeral scratchpad | No |
| Self-hosting (manages own codebase) | Planned — PLAN_SELF_HOSTED.md | No | No | No |
| Supervisor orchestrating multiple agents | Yes — LLM-driven supervisor dispatches 5+ workflows | No | No | No |
| GitHub-native (no external services) | Yes — Actions + Copilot SDK only | Yes | No — external SaaS | No — local/cloud |
| Distributable as template | Yes — `npm init` into any repo | No | No | No |
| Formal planning theory | Yes — NONLIN/UCPOP-derived partial-order planning | No | No | No |
| Price | Free (OSS) + Copilot subscription | Free with Copilot | [$20/mo+](https://devin.ai/pricing/) | $20-40/mo |

### Three tiers of differentiation

**Tier 1 — What works today (MVP):** A continuous autonomous loop running on GitHub infrastructure. 27 features, all implemented. Nine task handlers, supervisor orchestration, TDD mode, discussions bot, TOML configuration, mission-driven development. This alone is distinctive — no competitor has the continuous loop.

**Tier 2 — Self-hosting (PLAN_SELF_HOSTED.md):** The system can manage its own codebase. Bootstrap tests prove the SDK can clone itself and make useful increments, and an empty repo can converge toward a known target version. This is a practical demonstration of recursive self-improvement — a topic the [ICLR 2026 RSI workshop](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2026/workshop/10000796) and [Manifold prediction markets](https://manifold.markets/MaxHarms/will-ai-be-recursively-self-improvi) are actively debating.

**Tier 3 — The conceptual model (CONCEPT.md):** Partial-order planning with causal links, threat detection, truth maintenance, event calculus, and belief revision. Perspectives (how agents see) and capabilities (composable building blocks for agent assembly). The 7-step transformation engine: assess, plan, solve, assemble, execute, witness, iterate. This draws on classical AI planning theory (Tate's NONLIN, Penberthy & Weld's UCPOP, Steel & Ho's planning-execution integration) applied to software engineering for the first time.

## What We've Built

An autonomous coding system that lives entirely inside a GitHub repository. Install it, write a MISSION.md, and the repository evolves itself — generating issues, writing code, running tests, opening PRs, maintaining documentation, and engaging with users through GitHub Discussions.

The system has no external dependencies beyond GitHub. It runs as GitHub Actions workflows on configurable schedules, uses the GitHub Copilot SDK for decision-making, and is distributed as a single npm package.

## Three Audiences, Three Stories

### For developers (the loop)

> `npx @xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib init` — then write your mission. Nine agentic task handlers run as GitHub Actions workflows. No external services. No API keys beyond GitHub. TOML-configurable. MIT-licensed distributed code.

**What they care about:** Does it work? Can I try it in 10 minutes? What happens when it breaks?

**Launch asset:** The demo. A 3-minute screencast showing mission → autonomous evolution → working code. The "walk away, come back to merged PRs" proof.

### For researchers (the theory)

> intentïon applies classical AI partial-order planning (NONLIN, UCPOP) to autonomous software development — with committed planning artifacts, causal links, truth maintenance, and budget-constrained decision tree search. Self-hosting bootstrap tests provide measurable evidence of recursive self-improvement in a practical engineering context.

**What they care about:** Is the theoretical contribution novel? Is it reproducible? Does self-hosting actually work?

**Launch asset:** A technical paper or workshop submission. The bootstrap test results (clone-self convergence scores, empty-bootstrap N→N+1 convergence). Submission to [ICLR 2026 RSI workshop](https://recursive-workshop.github.io/) or a software engineering venue.

### For GitHub / Microsoft (the ecosystem)

> intentïon is the most advanced Copilot SDK integration in the wild. A complete autonomous development lifecycle — supervisor orchestration, multi-agent workflows, discussions bot, template distribution — built entirely on GitHub's own infrastructure. And it's heading toward self-hosting.

**What they care about:** Does this showcase what their platform can do? Is it good for the ecosystem?

**Launch asset:** Marketplace listing for `agentic-step`. A GitHub Universe talk proposal. A blog post framing intentïon as what [GitHub's custom agents](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/whats-new-with-github-copilot-coding-agent/) could become.

## Launch Plan

### Phase 1: Demonstrate (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal:** Create an irrefutable demo and the self-hosting proof.

- [ ] Record a 3-minute screencast: create repo from template → write MISSION.md → time-lapse the autonomous cycle → show resulting PRs and working code
- [ ] Create 3 demo repositories showing different missions:
  - CLI tool (CSV to JSON converter)
  - Library (string utilities package)
  - Web component (markdown renderer)
- [ ] Each demo shows the full lifecycle: issues created, code generated, tests passing, PRs merged, discussions bot responding
- [ ] Run self-hosting bootstrap tests (PLAN_SELF_HOSTED.md Phase 1) and record the results — clone-self and empty-bootstrap convergence scores
- [ ] Write the narrative blog post: "I wrote a sentence and got a working project — then the project started improving itself"

### Phase 2: Publish (Weeks 2-4)

**Goal:** Make it findable across two channels — developer community and research community.

Developer channel:
- [ ] Show HN: "An npm package that makes your GitHub repo evolve itself"
- [ ] Reddit r/programming, r/github, r/artificial
- [ ] Dev.to / Hashnode blog post
- [ ] Twitter/X with demo GIFs
- [ ] Submit to GitHub Marketplace as an Action (agentic-step)
- [ ] List on Product Hunt
- [ ] Ensure npm README matches GitHub README

Research channel:
- [ ] Write a short technical paper: "Self-Hosting Autonomous Development: Partial-Order Planning for Recursive Software Improvement"
- [ ] Frame around: classical AI planning theory + practical GitHub-native implementation + bootstrap test results
- [ ] Target: ICLR 2026 RSI workshop, or ICSE/FSE software engineering venue
- [ ] Publish bootstrap test data (convergence scores, pass rates) as reproducible artifacts

### Phase 3: Engage (Weeks 4-6)

**Goal:** Build community and credibility on both fronts.

- [ ] Respond to every HN/Reddit comment
- [ ] Create "Getting Started in 5 minutes" video
- [ ] Write comparison posts: "intentïon vs GitHub Agentic Workflows" and "intentïon vs Copilot Coding Agent"
- [ ] Reach out to AI/DevOps newsletter authors
- [ ] Submit a talk proposal to GitHub Universe / DevOps Days
- [ ] Open a "Show & Tell" discussion in agentic-lib for early users
- [ ] Engage with ICLR RSI workshop community — discuss self-hosting results, safety implications, convergence metrics

### Phase 4: Iterate and Extend (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Respond to feedback, advance the conceptual model, build the research case.

- [ ] Track which missions succeed and which fail — build a mission difficulty taxonomy
- [ ] Implement CONCEPT.md Phase 1: persistent planning artifact (committed partial-order plan)
- [ ] Implement convergence scoring across versions (Extension C from PLAN_SELF_HOSTED.md)
- [ ] Add canary self-host check to release.yml (Extension B from PLAN_SELF_HOSTED.md)
- [ ] Add seed templates for more ecosystems (Python, Rust, etc.)
- [ ] Consider a web UI for mission editing and real-time dashboard
- [ ] Develop the full 7-step engine loop from CONCEPT.md

## Messaging

### One-liner
> Write a mission. Watch it build itself. Let it improve itself.

### Elevator pitch
> intentïon is an open-source system that turns any GitHub repository into an autonomous, self-evolving codebase. You write a mission statement, and the system generates features, creates issues, writes code, runs tests, merges PRs, and maintains documentation — continuously, on a configurable schedule, using the GitHub Copilot SDK. A supervisor agent orchestrates the pipeline. Users interact through GitHub Discussions. And the system is heading toward self-hosting — managing its own codebase with its own workflows.

### For the research community
> intentïon applies classical AI partial-order planning theory — causal links, threat detection, open conditions, truth maintenance, event calculus — to autonomous software development. Planning artifacts are committed to the repository and refined across cycles, not ephemeral. Self-hosting bootstrap tests provide measurable convergence metrics for recursive self-improvement in a practical engineering context. Built entirely on GitHub Actions and the Copilot SDK, the system is reproducible and inspectable.

### For decision-makers
> An open-source system that turns any GitHub repository into a self-evolving codebase. Reduce the overhead of issue triage, documentation maintenance, and routine code changes. The AI works within your existing GitHub permissions and CI/CD pipeline — no new vendors, no data leaving GitHub. Heading toward self-hosting: the system manages its own development, providing a continuous quality signal.

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub builds a supervisor layer into [Agentic Workflows](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/whats-new-with-github-copilot-coding-agent/) | Medium | Our planning theory, self-hosting, and MISSION.md-driven approach remain distinctive. GitHub validates the architecture; we differentiate on depth. |
| Copilot SDK changes or access restrictions | Low-medium | Architecture is model-agnostic. The copilot.js adapter can be swapped. Local LLM backend (PLAN_LOCAL_SCENARIO_TESTS.md) provides a fallback. |
| Early users hit mission failures | High | Curate demo repos showing successful missions. Provide troubleshooting guides. Track mission success/failure rates to improve prompts. |
| Self-hosting tests don't pass reliably with tiny models | High | Local LLM tests prove mechanics, not capability. Add Copilot SDK variant (Extension D) for genuine self-hosting proof. Be transparent about what local tests demonstrate vs what they don't. |
| Research community dismisses it as "just engineering" | Medium | Ground the paper in established planning theory (NONLIN, UCPOP, Steel & Ho). The self-hosting bootstrap test is a concrete, reproducible, novel result. Frame as applied AI planning, not just DevOps tooling. |
| [Devin 2.0](https://devin.ai/pricing/) at $20/mo undercuts on polish | Medium | intentïon is free, open-source, GitHub-native, and heading toward self-hosting. Different value proposition: own your infrastructure vs rent a service. |

## Economics

### Cost structure: near-zero

intentïon costs almost nothing to run or distribute:

| Resource | Who pays | Cost to intentïon |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Actions minutes | User (free for public repos) | $0 |
| GitHub Copilot SDK | User (included with Copilot subscription) | $0 |
| npm publishing | OIDC trusted publishing, no tokens | $0 |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages / repo / Actions | $0 |
| Infrastructure | User's GitHub account | $0 |
| Distribution | `npm install` / `npx init` | $0 |

The user brings their own compute (Actions), their own AI (Copilot), and their own hosting (GitHub). intentïon is pure machinery — it costs nothing to stamp out another copy.

This is a structural advantage over every funded competitor: Devin needs to run inference servers. Cursor needs to host cloud agents. intentïon runs on infrastructure the user already has.

### Why there's no SaaS play

An earlier idea was backend services (persistent "memories", analytics, curated knowledge) offered through the Marketplace action. This doesn't work because:

1. **The LLM handles it locally.** All state lives as committed files in the repo — `intentïon.md`, `features/`, `library/`, the planning artifact. There's nothing a backend service adds that a committed file doesn't.
2. **It kills the differentiator.** "Just GitHub — no external services, your data never leaves" is the strongest competitive claim. A backend service turns intentïon into another vendor.
3. **Costs are zero without it.** There's no infrastructure to pay for, so there's no cost pressure to monetize.

### Revenue: attention, not subscription

The project is open source (GPL core, MIT distributed) with near-zero costs. There's no burn rate creating urgency to monetize. Revenue follows attention and credibility, not the other way around.

**What the project generates:**

| Asset | Value |
|---|---|
| Technical credibility | Portfolio piece, conference talks, research citations |
| Research contribution | Novel application of classical AI planning to autonomous development; self-hosting as practical recursive self-improvement |
| Industry visibility | GitHub Stars program, Marketplace listing, "most advanced Copilot SDK integration" narrative |
| Conversation with GitHub | "Here's what autonomous development looks like on your infrastructure" — partnership, accelerator, or feature adoption |
| Consulting leads | Mission engineering, enterprise setup, autonomous development strategy |

**Realistic revenue paths (if/when desired):**

| Path | What it looks like | Precondition |
|---|---|---|
| Consulting | Mission engineering, enterprise onboarding ($2-5k per engagement) | Demonstrated success with public demos |
| Research funding | EPSRC, Innovate UK, academic partnership to implement CONCEPT.md | Published paper + university collaborator |
| GitHub partnership | Feature adoption, accelerator, or acqui-hire | Marketplace traction + self-hosting proof |
| Conference / teaching | Paid workshops on autonomous development patterns | Community recognition |

**What's explicitly NOT the plan:**

- No managed service (contradicts "just GitHub")
- No freemium tiers (there's nothing to gate — it's all open source)
- No backend services (see above)
- No subscription pricing (the user already pays GitHub, not us)
