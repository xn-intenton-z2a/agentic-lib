# intentïon agentic-lib

You probably want to start with the workflow documentation here: [WORKFLOWS-README.md](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/blob/main/WORKFLOWS-README.md)

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

## Overview

The agentic-lib provides essential utility functions and a command line interface (CLI) designed for automated GitHub workflows and general JavaScript applications. It emphasizes streamlined text processing, centralized logging, and configuration management to support autonomous code maintenance.

## Core Features

- **Text Processing Functions**: 
  - `simpleEcho`: Trims a non-empty string and returns a greeting in the format "Hello, <input>".
  - `simpleReverse`: Trims a non-empty string and returns its reversed form.

### Usage Examples

**simpleEcho Example:**

```js
import { simpleEcho } from './sandbox/source/simpleFunction.js';

const greeting = simpleEcho('  World  ');
console.log(greeting); // Expected output: "Hello, World"
```

**simpleReverse Example:**

```js
import { simpleReverse } from './sandbox/source/simpleFunction.js';

const reversed = simpleReverse('  Hello  ');
console.log(reversed); // Expected output: "olleH"
```

Both functions validate input and will throw an error with the message "Invalid input: must be a non-empty string" if provided an empty or whitespace-only string.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI provided in `src/lib/main.js` supports the following commands:

- `--help`: Displays detailed usage instructions and available commands.
- `--version`: Outputs the current version along with a timestamp.
- `--digest`: Simulates processing an AWS SQS event using a predefined digest to trigger workflow operations.

Example usage:

```bash
node src/lib/main.js --help
node src/lib/main.js --version
node src/lib/main.js --digest
```

If no command is provided, the CLI will display the usage instructions.

## Repository Mission

Inspired by our mission statement, agentic-lib is built to enable autonomous code maintenance through GitHub workflows that continuously review and evolve your repository. By integrating core utilities like text processing functions, robust logging, and a flexible CLI, the library supports real-time operational efficiency and code reliability.

For more details on our mission, please refer to [MISSION.md](../MISSION.md).
