# intentïon agentic-lib

You probably want to start with the workflow documentation here: [WORKFLOWS-README.md](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/blob/main/WORKFLOWS-README.md)

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

## Overview

agentic-lib provides essential utility functions and a command line interface (CLI) for automated GitHub workflows and JavaScript applications. It emphasizes streamlined text processing, centralized logging, and configuration management to support autonomous code maintenance.

## Core Features

- **Text Processing Functions**: 
  - `simpleEcho`: Accepts a non-empty string, trims it, logs the operation, and returns a greeting message in the format "Hello, <input>".
  - `simpleReverse`: Accepts a non-empty string, trims it, logs the operation, and returns the reversed string.

Both functions validate input and throw an error ("Invalid input: must be a non-empty string") for empty or whitespace-only inputs.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI, implemented in `src/lib/main.js`, supports these commands:

- `--help`: Displays detailed usage instructions and available commands.
- `--version`: Outputs the current version along with a timestamp.
- `--digest`: Simulates processing an AWS SQS event using a predefined digest.

Example usage:

```bash
node src/lib/main.js --help
node src/lib/main.js --version
node src/lib/main.js --digest
```

When no command is provided, the CLI prints usage instructions.

## Repository Mission

agentic-lib is designed to empower autonomous code maintenance via GitHub workflows that continuously review and evolve your repository. Integrating core utilities like text processing, robust logging, and a flexible CLI, the library enhances operational efficiency and code reliability.
