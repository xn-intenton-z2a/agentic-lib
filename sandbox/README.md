# agentic-lib

Agentic-lib is a JavaScript library which can be used as a drop-in JS implementation or wholesale replacement for steps, jobs, and reusable workflows in GitHub Actions. It enables repositories to operate in an “agentic” manner, where autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve code.

## CLI Usage
```bash
Usage:
  --help       Show this help message and usage instructions.
  --digest     Run a full bucket replay simulating an SQS event.
  --version    Show version information with current timestamp.
  --mission    Show the project mission statement (contents of MISSION.md).
```
