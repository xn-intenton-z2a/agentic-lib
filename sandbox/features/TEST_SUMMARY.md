# Objective and Scope
Enhance the test console output summarizer to not only produce structured summaries of Vitest runs but also ensure the underlying logging utilities (logInfo and logError) behave as expected. This covers both successful and error scenarios, verifying log entries are correctly formatted and include required metadata.

# Value Proposition
By extending test coverage to include logInfo and logError, we guarantee consistency and reliability of our logging mechanisms. Developers gain confidence in log output for both normal operation and error handling, improving debugging and monitoring in both local and CI environments.

# Requirements

## Summary Generation and Logging Validation
- Maintain existing summarizer behavior when `--summarize-tests` is used.
- Ensure logInfo emits a JSON object to stdout with:
  - level: "info"
  - timestamp: valid ISO string
  - message: provided text
  - optional verbose flag when VERBOSE_MODE is enabled
- Ensure logError emits a JSON object to stderr with:
  - level: "error"
  - timestamp: valid ISO string
  - message: provided text
  - error field when an Error object is supplied
  - stack field when VERBOSE_MODE is enabled and error contains a stack

## Test File Updates
- Add new unit tests in tests/unit/logOutput.test.js:
  - Test logInfo with sample messages and capture stdout; parse JSON and assert properties.
  - Test logError with sample Error object and capture stderr; parse JSON and assert properties, including error and stack when verbose.
  - Simulate VERBOSE_MODE by temporarily setting internal flag or environment to trigger verbose metadata.
- Update testSummary.test.js to verify that the summary output still prints an info log prefix and correct JSON summary when the summarizer runs.

## CLI Integration
- Verify that invoking `npm run test -- --reporter=json --output tests/results.json` followed by `npm run start -- --summarize-tests` produces both:
  - Human-readable summary
  - JSON summary prefixed by an info log entry emitted via logInfo

# Verification and Acceptance
- Unit tests for logInfo and logError must cover at least 90% of branches in those functions.
- Integration test simulating a Vitest JSON results file and invoking `--summarize-tests` should pass and output the combined logs and summary as expected.
- Manual review: run `npx agentic-lib --summarize-tests` after a test run and confirm log formatting and summary correctness.
