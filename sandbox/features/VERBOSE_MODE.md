# Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI flag --verbose which activates verbose mode for the application. When enabled, the feature sets the logging and statistics flags to provide detailed runtime information, facilitating debugging and in-depth analysis of operations.

# Implementation Details
1. Modify the main CLI code in src/lib/main.js:
   - Change the global VERBOSE_MODE and VERBOSE_STATS variables from constants to mutable variables (e.g., using let) to allow runtime updates.
   - At the start of the CLI processing in the main function, check if the arguments contain the flag --verbose. If present, set VERBOSE_MODE and VERBOSE_STATS to true.
   - Ensure that all log functions (logInfo, logError) utilize the updated VERBOSE_MODE flag to include additional details (such as stack traces and extra data when available).
2. Update the CLI usage instructions (generated by the generateUsage function) to include details about the --verbose flag. Describe how users can invoke detailed logging using this option.
3. Update the README file to document the new flag. Add a section under CLI Usage that explains the benefit of --verbose for debugging and details what extra information is provided when it is enabled.
4. Modify or extend unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js to simulate CLI invocations with the --verbose flag. Verify that when --verbose is present, the application provides additional logging output and statistics in the CLI output.

# Success Criteria
- Invoking the CLI with --verbose correctly sets verbose mode and displays additional information in the logs and statistics.
- The generateUsage function output includes an entry for the --verbose flag.
- Updates in testing confirm that verbose mode is activated when the flag is present.
- The README is updated to clearly document the new --verbose flag and its benefits.

# User Impact
- Users can now easily enable detailed logging for troubleshooting and performance analysis.
- Developers benefit from improved diagnostics, making it easier to trace issues and understand application behavior under various conditions.
- The feature enhances overall transparency without impacting default behavior for general users.
