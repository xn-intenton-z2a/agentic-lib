# Sandbox CLI

This feature document outlines the CLI utilities available in the **agentic-lib** sandbox. Each command embodies our mission of autonomous, agentic workflows, empowering your repository to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve code. Use the CLI flags described in the documentation (e.g., `--validate-features`, `--generate-interactive-examples`) to interact with the sandbox functionality.
