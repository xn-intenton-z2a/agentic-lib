# Mission Alignment

AGENTIC_CORE consolidates all essential core capabilities of agentic-lib into a single coherent feature, fully realizing the mission to enable autonomous, continuous agentic interactions. It provides unified environment configuration, structured logging, AWS SQS utilities, Lambda handlers, CLI-driven workflows, and the self-hosted HTTP server for observability and documentation.

# Feature Overview

- **Environment Configuration**
  Load and validate environment variables using dotenv and Zod to ensure consistent, reproducible conditions in autonomous workflows.

- **Structured Logging Helpers**
  Export logInfo and logError functions producing JSON-formatted logs with levels, timestamps, messages, and optional context for transparent audit trails.

- **AWS SQS Utilities & Lambda Handler**
  Provide createSQSEventFromDigest to craft mock SQS events and digestLambdaHandler to process records with error handling, failure reporting, and support for AWS batchItemFailures semantics.

- **CLI Interface**
  Support --help, --version, and --digest flags in main CLI, enabling users to display usage instructions, version information with timestamp, and simulate SQS digest events.

- **HTTP Server**
  startServer function exposing critical endpoints: /health, /metrics (Prometheus metrics), /openapi.json, /docs (interactive docs), /config and /version, all supporting CORS, Basic Auth when configured, and integrated rate-limit headers.

# Configuration & Environment Variables

- GITHUB_API_BASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY  
- PORT, CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS, RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS, RATE_LIMIT_HEADERS_ENABLED  
- METRICS_USER, METRICS_PASS, DOCS_USER, DOCS_PASS, CONFIG_USER, CONFIG_PASS, VERSION_USER, VERSION_PASS

# Success Criteria & Acceptance

- Environment variables validated and loaded; logs produced as JSON with correct fields.
- digestLambdaHandler returns correct batchItemFailures and logs for valid and invalid records.
- CLI flags produce usage, version JSON, and trigger SQS digest simulation.
- HTTP endpoints respond correctly with expected payloads, headers, authentication, rate-limiting behavior, and integrated rate-limit headers.
- All existing tests for server, main import, and module index continue to pass; new tests added to cover logging, config validation, CLI, and Lambda handler.

# Testability & Stability

- Vitest tests should cover environment schema parsing, log output format, digestLambdaHandler error and success paths, CLI flag handling, and HTTP server endpoints including auth and rate-limit scenarios.
- Fail-safe mechanisms: invalid configs throw errors at startup, HTTP and Lambda handlers capture errors and record failures appropriately.
