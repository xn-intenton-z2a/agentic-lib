# Mission Alignment

Unify environment configuration, structured logging, AWS SQS utilities, CLI interface, HTTP server endpoints (including readiness probe and latency histogram), and GitHub API integration into a single cohesive core feature that powers autonomous, continuous agentic workflows.

# Configuration

Load and validate environment variables via dotenv and Zod. Expose a config object with:

- GITHUB_API_BASE_URL (defaults to GitHubâ€™s public API or a test base URL in development)
- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for GitHub Integration)
- OPENAI_API_KEY (for future AI-driven operations)
- PORT (default 3000)
- CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS (default "*")
- RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS (requests per minute per IP, default 60)
- METRICS_USER, METRICS_PASS (optional Basic Auth for metrics endpoint)
- DOCS_USER, DOCS_PASS (optional Basic Auth for docs endpoint)

Ensure sensible defaults and proper Zod validation in test and development modes.

# Logging Helpers

Provide logInfo and logError functions that emit structured JSON logs containing:

- level
- timestamp
- message
- optional error details and stack when verbose mode is enabled

# AWS Utilities

Implement createSQSEventFromDigest to wrap a digest object into an AWS SQS event shape and digestLambdaHandler to:

- iterate and parse SQS records
- log successes and detailed failures
- return batchItemFailures for invalid records

# CLI Interface

Support the following flags on the CLI:

- --help: display usage instructions
- --version: read and output version from package.json along with a timestamp
- --digest: simulate an SQS event with an example digest and invoke digestLambdaHandler

# HTTP Server

Extend startServer to launch an HTTP server with the following endpoints:

- GET /health
  Liveness probe returning JSON with status "ok", uptime, and timestamp.
- GET /ready
  Readiness probe returning JSON with status "ready" and timestamp.
- GET /metrics
  Prometheus metrics in text format for http_requests_total, http_request_failures_total, and http_request_duration_seconds histogram. Protected by Basic Auth if METRICS_USER/METRICS_PASS are set.
- GET /openapi.json
  Returns the OpenAPI 3.0 schema for all endpoints.
- GET /docs
  Renders the OpenAPI schema as interactive HTML via Markdown. Protected by Basic Auth if DOCS_USER/DOCS_PASS are set.

Apply IP-based token bucket rate limiting per IP, handle CORS, record metrics for each request and failure, and measure request duration to populate a latency histogram.

# GitHub Integration

Use the @octokit/rest library to initialize a GitHub API client with GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_API_BASE_URL. Export utility functions:

- createIssue
- commentOnIssue
- createBranch
- mergePullRequest
- listOpenPullRequests

Log errors with logError and rethrow for upstream handling.

# Testing and Success Criteria

Add unit and integration tests to cover:

- Configuration loading and validation
- Structured logging output and error cases
- AWS utilities and SQS simulation
- CLI flags behavior (--help, --version, --digest)
- HTTP endpoints (/health, /ready, /metrics, /openapi.json, /docs), including success and failure cases, authentication, rate limiting, and histogram population
- GitHub integration utilities with mocked Octokit responses

Verify metrics counters and latency histogram are incremented correctly in each scenario.

# Documentation Updates

- Update sandbox/docs/SERVER.md to document the /ready endpoint and request duration histogram
- Refresh sandbox/docs/SQS_OVERVIEW.md for AWS utilities
- Create or update sandbox/docs/GITHUB_API_INTEGRATION.md with usage examples and reference for exported GitHub functions
- Update sandbox/README.md under Key Features to include readiness probe and latency histogram metrics
