# Objective & Scope
Define a new CLI flag --crawl that accepts one or more URLs, fetches each resource using the Node 20 fetch API, and converts each response into a standardized SQS event for downstream processing.

# Value Proposition
Enables direct ingestion of external data sources into the existing event pipeline. Simplifies the initial crawling step and provides a unified interface for retrieving remote content, laying the groundwork for building the knowledge graph of the physical world.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- Recognize a --crawl flag in the CLI and parse a comma-separated list of URLs supplied as the next argument.
- For each URL:
  - Use fetch to retrieve the resource.
  - Construct a digest object with fields url, status, body, and timestamp.
  - Invoke createSQSEventFromDigest to wrap the digest in an SQS event.
  - Call digestLambdaHandler with the generated event.
  - Log an info entry for each successful fetch.
  - On fetch failure or non-2xx status, log an error entry including URL, status or error message, and continue processing remaining URLs.
- Return true from processCrawl to signal that the flag was handled and terminate further CLI processing.

# Testability & Stability
- Unit tests mock global fetch to simulate successful and failed HTTP responses.
- Verify that createSQSEventFromDigest and digestLambdaHandler are called with the correct digest structure.
- Assert that logInfo contains expected URL and timestamp fields on success.
- Assert that logError is called with descriptive error messages on failure.
- Confirm that main exits early when --crawl is present and does not process other CLI flags.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- No additional dependencies; rely on built-in Node 20 fetch API.
- Leverage existing utilities: createSQSEventFromDigest, digestLambdaHandler, logInfo, and logError.
- Changes limited to src/lib/main.js, relevant test files under tests/unit, sandbox/source/main.js, and sandbox/tests.

# User Scenarios & Examples
- Single URL: node src/lib/main.js --crawl https://example.com/data.json
- Multiple URLs: node src/lib/main.js --crawl https://a.com,https://b.org
- Confirm console output of JSON-encoded SQS events and log entries for each URL.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Use vitest to run new tests under tests/unit and sandbox/tests.
- Manual confirmation that CLI invocation with real URLs produces valid SQS event objects and error logs.
- Code review verifies adherence to project style, ESM standards, and existing logging conventions.
