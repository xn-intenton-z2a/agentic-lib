# Objective & Scope
Ensure the primary README accurately reflects the current repository state, mission progress, and available CLI functionality. Focus on updating sandbox/README.md to align with implemented commands and provide clear guidance to users.

# Value Proposition
• Keeps documentation reliable and up to date, reducing confusion and support inquiries.
• Demonstrates mission alignment by summarizing progress and linking to mission artifacts.
• Improves onboarding experience by consolidating command usage examples and resource links in one place.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
• sandbox/README.md contains:
  – A concise description inspired by the Mission Statement.
  – Up-to-date list of available CLI flags: --help, --diagram, --features-overview, --digest, --version, --health, --release-notes.
  – Usage examples for each flag demonstrating markdown and JSON outputs where applicable.
  – Links to MISSION.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, and GitHub repository.
  – A section summarizing mission progress (version, recent milestones).
• Changes committed to sandbox/README.md only; no other files modified.
• At least 90% coverage for new documentation updates in sandbox/tests/cli.test.js verifying example fragments appear as expected.

# Implementation Details
1. Load sandbox/README.md template and update sections:
   • Intro paragraph with mission summary and link to MISSION.md.
   • CLI Toolkit section enumerating commands and options.
   • Examples block for each flag showing expected output (mermaid, JSON arrays, version info).
   • Footer with links to CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, and GitHub repo.
2. Use consistent markdown formatting and lint with existing style guidelines.
3. Commit updated README content within sandbox/README.md file.

# Testing & Verification
• Extend sandbox/tests/cli.test.js or add new tests to assert presence of updated README sections and example syntax.
• Run npm test to ensure no test regressions.
• Manual review of rendered README in GitHub preview to verify formatting and links.
