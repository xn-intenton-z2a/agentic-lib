# Provide a built-in HTTP interface that allows external systems (for example, CI pipelines or webhook providers) to invoke core agentic-lib functionality via REST endpoints. This feature leverages the existing Express dependency without introducing new files beyond source, test, README, and package.json, and it remains fully compatible with GitHub Actions workflows.
