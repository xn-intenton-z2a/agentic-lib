# Objective & Scope

Provide a unified HTTP interface and complementary CLI flags to expose core agentic-lib functionality without adding new files beyond source, tests, README, and package.json. This feature covers service health, digest processing, webhook intake, mission and feature discovery, and in-memory runtime metrics in a single Express application.
