# VERBOSE FLAG FEATURE SPECIFICATION

## Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI flag --verbose that enables verbose logging mode throughout the application. When the flag is present, all logging functions will include additional debug information. This enhances the tool's usability by providing more detailed runtime insights for troubleshooting and performance monitoring, and aligns with the mission of making agentic-lib more transparent and self-documenting.

## Implementation Details
1. Modify the main source file (src/lib/main.js) to check for the --verbose flag. If present, set the global VERBOSE_MODE to true before any logging calls.
2. Update the CLI usage instructions in the generateUsage function to include the new --verbose flag.
3. Ensure that verbose logs include extra details where applicable. For example, include additional context in logInfo calls when VERBOSE_MODE is true.
4. Update the README file in sandbox/README.md to include documentation for the --verbose flag within the usage examples.
5. No new dependencies are added, and adjustments are confined to existing files: the main source file, tests, and documentation.

## Testing and Verification
1. Update the test files (tests/unit/main.test.js) to simulate CLI calls including the --verbose flag and verify that verbose logging is activated (e.g., using spies or mocks on console.log and console.error).
2. Ensure that other CLI flags (e.g., --help, --version, --digest) continue to function as expected, with additional verbose logs when --verbose is provided.
3. Run the complete test suite with the command npm test to verify no regressions are introduced.

## Dependencies and Constraints
This feature does not require adding new dependencies. It simply leverages existing logging mechanisms and modifies command line argument parsing. The changes are consistent with the contributions guidelines and mission statement of agentic-lib.
