# Value Proposition

Guarantee the project entrypoint aligns with module-index tests by providing a default export in the main library and synchronizing test imports.

# Success Criteria & Requirements

## Default Export in Main Library

- In `src/lib/main.js` add a default export of `undefined` at the end of the file without altering existing exports or logic.

## Test Import Path Correction

- In `tests/unit/module-index.test.js` replace the import source `@src/index.js` with the relative path `../../src/lib/main.js` so the test resolves correctly.

## Verification & Acceptance

- All existing tests in `tests/unit/` and `sandbox/tests/` must pass with no regressions.
- Specifically, the module-index test should import the default export and receive `undefined` without import errors.

# Dependencies & Constraints

- No new files are created or deleted.
- Changes are limited to `src/lib/main.js` and `tests/unit/module-index.test.js`.

# User Scenarios & Examples

- When running `npm test`, the module-index test should load the main library via the corrected path and confirm the default export is `undefined`.
