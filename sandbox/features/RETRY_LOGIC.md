# Overview
This feature introduces automatic retry capabilities for transient failures during agentic command processing. The retry logic will detect errors flagged as transient and reattempt the operation a configurable number of times before failing. This improves reliability and resilience of the command processing workflow.

# Implementation Details
1. A new helper function, performWithRetry, will be added. This function will accept an async callback, a maximum number of retries (default from environment variable RETRY_ATTEMPTS or a default constant), and an optional delay between retries.

2. The agenticHandler and workflowChainHandler functions will be wrapped to call performWithRetry when processing commands. If an error message contains the substring TransientError, the operation is retried.

3. A new CLI flag, --retry, will be added. When specified, it will enable the retry mechanism for CLI invocations. Optionally, a user may set the maximum number of retries via an environment variable or an additional argument.

4. Tests will be updated to simulate transient error conditions. The tests will verify that when a transient error occurs, the command is retried and eventually a success is returned if one of the retries passes.

5. Documentation in the README and relevant doc files will be updated to explain the new --retry flag and the retry behavior.

# Success Criteria
- The performWithRetry function correctly wraps an async task and retries when the error message includes "TransientError".
- agenticHandler and workflowChainHandler successfully reattempt transient failures up to the maximum specified attempts.
- CLI invocations with --retry provide improved resiliency, as verified via updated unit tests.
- README and documentation clearly describe how to use the --retry flag and adjust the number of retry attempts.

# User Impact
- Users experience improved reliability when transient errors occur during command processing.
- The retry mechanism minimizes disruptions due to temporary issues such as network instability or intermittent resource unavailability.
- Clear documentation and CLI flag usage allow users to easily configure retry behavior as needed.
