# GitHub API (REST v3 and Octokit)
## https://docs.github.com/en/rest
## https://github.com/octokit/rest.js#readme
This combined reference provides in-depth specifications of GitHub's REST API (v3), including endpoint definitions, authentication flows (personal access tokens and OAuth apps), pagination strategies, rate limiting behaviors, and standardized error codes. The Octokit Rest.js client complements these raw HTTP details with a high-level JavaScript/TypeScript interface, offering built-in pagination helpers, plugin architecture, and type-safe method signatures. Practical code snippets demonstrate both direct HTTP interactions and client-driven workflows, ensuring seamless integration for repository and issue management in agentic-lib. Continuously updated by GitHub (last verified April 2024); highly authoritative as the official provider of the API and client libraries.

# GitHub GraphQL API & Octokit GraphQL
## https://docs.github.com/en/graphql
## https://github.com/octokit/graphql.js#readme
This source delves into GitHub's GraphQL API, presenting schema introspection, query and mutation constructs, pagination via cursors, and authentication scopes. It outlines how to craft flexible, batched requests to minimize network overhead and offers guidelines for handling rate limits and error responses. The Octokit GraphQL.js client simplifies GraphQL calls in JavaScript/TypeScript, providing typed query templates, middleware hooks, and built‐in retry logic. Essential for advanced data retrieval scenarios where REST endpoints are insufficient. Documentation last updated March 2024; offers official schema details and client integrations.

# GitHub Actions Workflow Syntax
## https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
This official guide specifies the complete YAML structure for GitHub Actions workflows, including event triggers (`on.push`, `workflow_call`), job definitions, matrix and concurrency strategies, environment variables, and secrets management. It covers advanced topics like reusable workflows, composite actions, and permissions hardening, enabling secure and efficient CI/CD pipelines. Directly informs agentic-lib’s workflow templates to enforce best practices and robust automation composition. Published March 2024; maintained by GitHub.

# AWS Serverless Integration: Lambda, SQS, and S3 Bridge Patterns
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-lambda/
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html
## https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/s3-sqs-bridge#readme
This unified reference covers AWS SDK v3 Lambda Client features (InvokeCommand, middleware stack, credential resolution, retry strategies, TypeScript support), AWS Lambda Node.js handler patterns (`exports.handler` vs. async, context object, error propagation, cold starts, CloudWatch logging), SQS event mapping (JSON event schema, batchItemFailures pattern, retry semantics, dead-letter queues), and S3-to-SQS bridging using the s3-sqs-bridge library with IAM policy templates, batching configurations, and error-handling hooks. Provides actionable patterns for reliable, event-driven serverless workflows in agentic-lib. AWS docs updated February 2024; s3-sqs-bridge v0.24.0 (MIT).

# Environment Configuration & Validation (dotenv & Zod)
## https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv
## https://github.com/colinhacks/zod
This combined source covers robust environment management: dotenv for loading, expanding, and validating `.env` files (default values, variable expansion, error fallbacks) and Zod for declarative schema validation with TypeScript type inference, custom error formatting, and runtime safety. Offers integration patterns to ensure configuration correctness and clear failure modes in both development and production environments. dotenv v16.x released October 2023; Zod v3.x released December 2023.
