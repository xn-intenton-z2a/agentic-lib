# Environment Configuration (dotenv + Zod)
## https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme
Official `dotenv` documentation for loading environment variables from `.env` files in Node.js, covering default values, variable expansion, and security considerations. When paired with Zod schema validation (https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), enables runtime type checking and clear error reporting for missing or malformed configuration, enforcing robust, type-safe pipelines. Essential for consistent environment loading and validation in CLI, Lambda, and server components. Last updated March 2024; widely adopted community standard.
