# GitHub API (REST v3 and Octokit)
## https://docs.github.com/en/rest
## https://github.com/octokit/rest.js#readme
This combined reference provides in-depth specifications of GitHub's REST API (v3), including endpoint definitions, authentication flows (personal access tokens and OAuth apps), pagination strategies, rate limiting behaviors, and standardized error codes. The Octokit Rest.js client complements these raw HTTP details with a high-level JavaScript/TypeScript interface, offering built-in pagination helpers, plugin architecture, and type-safe method signatures. Practical code snippets demonstrate both direct HTTP interactions and client-driven workflows, ensuring seamless integration for repository and issue management in agentic-lib. Continuously updated by GitHub (last verified April 2024); licensed under CC BY 4.0 (REST API) and MIT (Octokit).

# GitHub GraphQL API & Octokit GraphQL
## https://docs.github.com/en/graphql
## https://github.com/octokit/graphql.js#readme
This source delves into GitHub's GraphQL API, presenting schema introspection, query and mutation constructs, pagination via cursors, and authentication scopes. It outlines how to craft flexible, batched requests to minimize network overhead and offers guidelines for handling rate limits and error responses. The Octokit GraphQL.js client simplifies GraphQL calls in JavaScript/TypeScript, providing typed query templates, middleware hooks, and built‐in retry logic. Essential for advanced data retrieval scenarios where REST endpoints are insufficient. Documentation last updated March 2024; licensed under CC BY 4.0 (GraphQL API) and MIT (Octokit GraphQL).

# GitHub Actions Workflow Syntax
## https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
This official guide specifies the complete YAML structure for GitHub Actions workflows, including event triggers (`on.push`, `workflow_call`), job definitions, matrix and concurrency strategies, environment variables, and secrets management. It covers advanced topics like reusable workflows, composite actions, and permissions hardening, enabling secure and efficient CI/CD pipelines. Directly informs agentic-lib’s workflow templates and ensures best practices for automation composition. Published March 2024; CC BY 4.0 licensed.

# AWS SQS & S3 Integration: Event Mapping & Bridge Library
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html
## https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/s3-sqs-bridge#readme
This dual reference explains how to wire AWS SQS queues into Lambda functions, detailing JSON event schema, batch size configuration, retry semantics, and dead-letter queue patterns. The s3-sqs-bridge library README extends these concepts by illustrating how to route S3 bucket notifications into SQS with IAM permission templates, batching strategies, and error-handling hooks. Together, they provide actionable patterns for reliable, event-driven workflows in agentic-lib. AWS docs updated February 2024 (Apache 2.0); bridge library version 0.24.0 (MIT licensed).

# AWS Lambda Client (AWS SDK v3)
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-lambda/
This documentation describes the AWS SDK v3 Lambda Client, covering core commands such as `InvokeCommand`, `InvokeAsyncCommand`, client middleware stack configuration, credential resolution, retry strategies, and TypeScript support. It details payload serialization/deserialization, invocation types (`Event`, `RequestResponse`, `DryRun`), and best practices for asynchronous Lambda orchestration and cross-function communication. Critical for agentic-lib’s programmatic Lambda invocations and error propagation. Last published January 2024; Apache 2.0 licensed.

# AWS Lambda Function Handler in Node.js
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-handler.html
This AWS guide outlines the Node.js Lambda handler interface, including function signatures (`exports.handler` vs. async handlers), the `context` object, callback behaviors, error propagation, and best practices for cold start optimization. It clarifies timeout settings, environment variable access, and logging integration with CloudWatch. Foundational for implementing reliable, performant `digestLambdaHandler` logic in agentic-lib.

# Environment Configuration & Validation (dotenv & Zod)
## https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv
## https://github.com/colinhacks/zod
This combined source covers robust environment management: dotenv for loading and expanding `.env` files (default values, variable expansion, error fallbacks) and Zod for declarative schema validation of environment variables and payloads. It explains custom error formatting, TypeScript type inference, and integration patterns that ensure configuration correctness and safe runtime behavior in both development and production. dotenv v16.x released October 2023 (BSD-2-Clause); Zod v3.x released December 2023 (MIT licensed).
