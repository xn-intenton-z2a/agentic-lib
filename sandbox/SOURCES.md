# GitHub Actions Official Documentation
## https://docs.github.com/en/actions
Comprehensive guide to configuring and running GitHub Actions workflows, covering workflow syntax (`on`, `jobs`, `steps`), expressions & contexts including functions and context objects (`github`, `env`, `job`, `steps`, `inputs`, `secrets`), environment files, concurrency controls, caching strategies, retention settings, reusable workflows via `workflow_call`, inputs/outputs, secrets propagation, permissions, composite actions, version pinning, parameter validation, and debugging tips. Essential for agentic-lib’s simulation engine to accurately parse and validate complex workflow definitions, nested calls, conditional execution, and parameter flows. Last updated: November 2023.

# GitHub API Reference
## https://docs.github.com/en/rest
Comprehensive REST API documentation covering endpoints for workflows (`dispatch`, `runs`), issues, pull requests, branches, authentication (OAuth, tokens, apps), pagination, rate limits, and error responses. Also includes GraphQL guidance for complex queries and batch mutations. Core to agentic-lib’s metadata retrieval, orchestration, and SDK integration for CI/CD automation. Last updated: October 2023.

# YAML Parsing & Specification
## https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html
Defines YAML 1.2 syntax, data typing, anchors/aliases, merge keys, and serialization details. Paired with the `js-yaml` library for JavaScript (v4.1.0) to support robust parsing, anchor resolution, and round-trip fidelity. Underpins agentic-lib’s workflow loader and ensures accurate mapping from user YAML to internal models, including edge cases like complex aliases and merge behaviors. Last updated: July 2021 (spec), May 2023 (`js-yaml`). Authoritative: YAML.org and js-yaml maintainers.

# Zod Schema Validation
## https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#readme
TypeScript-first schema validation library used to enforce environment configurations, CLI inputs, and API payloads. Documentation covers schema definitions, parsing modes, synchronous and asynchronous refinements, custom error handling, deep TypeScript integration, and error formatting—vital for robust configuration loading and runtime validation in agentic-lib.

# AWS Lambda & SQS Integration with AWS SDK for JavaScript v3
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html
Official AWS guide for event source mapping of SQS-triggered Lambda functions, detailing payload structures, batch sizes, partial failure mechanisms (`batchItemFailures`), retry semantics, scaling considerations, and best practices for error handling and throttling. Includes code snippets using AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 (modular clients, command patterns, middleware stacks), TypeScript definitions, and middleware customization. Critical for designing, invoking, and testing Lambda-based digest handlers in agentic-lib. Last updated: September 2023 (Lambda), May 2024 (SDK). Authoritative: AWS.

# OpenAI Node.js Client
## https://github.com/openai/openai-node
Official OpenAI API client documentation for Node.js, covering the `Configuration` class, `OpenAIApi` methods (chat, completions, edits), streaming APIs, error handling strategies, rate limiting, retry patterns, and TypeScript type definitions. Essential for leveraging AI-powered code generation and dynamic content refinement in agentic-lib workflows. Last updated: April 2024. Authoritative: OpenAI.

# Reusing Workflows (Reusable Workflows)
## https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows
In-depth guide to creating and invoking reusable workflows using `workflow_call`, detailing input/output parameter definitions, default values, `secrets`, and caller permissions. Includes best practices for versioning, composability, and debugging reusable workflows. Crucial for agentic-lib to support seamless simulation of nested and dependent workflow calls.
