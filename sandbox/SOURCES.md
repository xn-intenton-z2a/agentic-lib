# GitHub Actions Official Documentation
## https://docs.github.com/en/actions
Comprehensive guide to configuring and running GitHub Actions workflows, covering workflow syntax (`on`, `jobs`, `steps`), reusable workflows, expressions & contexts, environment files, concurrency controls, caching strategies, and retention settings. Essential for agentic-lib’s simulation engine to accurately parse and validate complex workflow definitions, nested calls, and conditional execution. Last updated: November 2023.

# GitHub API Reference
## https://docs.github.com/en/rest
Comprehensive REST API documentation covering endpoints for workflows (`dispatch`, `runs`), issues, pull requests, branches, authentication (OAuth, tokens, apps), pagination, rate limits, and error responses. Also includes GraphQL guidance for complex queries and batch mutations. Core to agentic-lib’s metadata retrieval, orchestration, and SDK integration for CI/CD automation. Last updated: October 2023.

# YAML Parsing & Specification
## https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html
Defines YAML 1.2 syntax, data typing, anchors/aliases, merge keys, and serialization details. Paired with the `js-yaml` library for JavaScript (v4.1.0) to support robust parsing, anchor resolution, and round-trip fidelity. Underpins agentic-lib’s workflow loader and ensures accurate mapping from user YAML to internal models, including edge cases like complex aliases and merge behaviors. Last updated: July 2021 (spec), May 2023 (`js-yaml`). Authoritative: YAML.org and js-yaml maintainers.

# AWS Lambda & SQS Integration with AWS SDK for JavaScript v3
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html
Official AWS guide for event source mapping of SQS-triggered Lambda functions, detailing payload structures, batch sizes, partial failure mechanisms (`batchItemFailures`), retry semantics, scaling considerations, and best practices for error handling and throttling. Includes code snippets using AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 (modular clients, command patterns, middleware stacks) and TypeScript definitions. Critical for designing, invoking, and testing Lambda-based digest handlers in agentic-lib. Last updated: September 2023 (Lambda), May 2024 (SDK). Authoritative: AWS.
