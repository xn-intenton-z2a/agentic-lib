# YAML Parsing & Specification
## https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html
The YAML 1.2 specification standardizes syntax rules, data typing, anchors/aliases, and serialization details. Paired with the `js-yaml` library (https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) for JavaScript parsing, it underpins agentic-lib’s workflow loader and ensures fidelity when translating YAML into internal models, including handling of complex alias and merge behaviors. Last updated: July 2021 (spec), `js-yaml` v4.1.0 last release: May 2023. Authoritative: YAML.org and js-yaml maintainers.
