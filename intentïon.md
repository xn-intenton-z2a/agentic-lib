# Mission Statement

**agentic‑lib** Is a JavaScript library which can be used as a drop in JS implementation or wholesale replacement for 
the steps, jobs, and re-usable workflows below in this repository. It is designed to be used in a GitHub Actions 
workflow to enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate
through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be
invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

+# Purpose
+Enhance the CLI to allow the --digest option to accept a file path containing a JSON payload. This enables developers and automated workflows to simulate real SQS events from arbitrary JSON files instead of a hard-coded example.
+
+# Specification
+
+1. Update Usage Instructions
+   • Modify the usage section to show:
+     --digest [<path>]
+   • Explain that the optional path argument points to a JSON file containing the event digest object.
+
+2. ProcessDigest Implementation
+   • When --digest is supplied with a file path:
+     - Read the file synchronously using fs.readFileSync
+     - Parse the file content as JSON; report and exit on parse errors
+     - Use the parsed object to create an SQS event via createSQSEventFromDigest
+     - Invoke digestLambdaHandler on the resulting event
+   • When --digest is supplied without an argument:
+     - Retain existing behavior with the exampleDigest fallback
+
+3. Error Handling
+   • If file reading fails (file not found or permission denied):
+     - Log an error with logError and exit process with non-zero code
+   • If JSON parsing fails:
+     - Log an error with logError including raw file content and error
+     - Exit process with non-zero code
+
+4. Tests and Validation
+   • Create unit tests to cover:
+     - Valid file path and proper dispatch to digestLambdaHandler
+     - Missing file path argument (fallback to default behavior)
+     - File not found or read error scenario
+     - Invalid JSON content scenario
+   • Use vitest mocks for fs and ensure logError is invoked correctly
+
+# Success Criteria & Acceptance
+
+- All new tests pass under npm test
+- generateUsage output mentions the optional file path
+- processDigest reads and parses external JSON files correctly
+- Errors in reading or parsing are surfaced and cause non-zero exit
+- Existing behavior without file argument remains unchanged
```
