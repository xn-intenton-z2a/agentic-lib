Maintained feature CHAT_COMPLETION.

Feature spec:

# Objective
Add a new CLI flag `--chat` that submits a user prompt to the OpenAI Chat Completion API and returns the model-generated response in JSON format.

# Value Proposition
Enable library users to interact with the OpenAI API directly from the CLI, powering quick prompt experimentation and integration into automated scripts without writing custom code.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- Introduce a processChat(args) function in src/lib/main.js that:
  - Detects the presence of the `--chat` flag followed by a prompt string.
  - Initializes OpenAI API client using existing OPENAI_API_KEY config.
  - Sends the prompt to createChatCompletion and awaits the response.
  - Outputs a JSON object to stdout with shape { response: <message content> }.
- Update the main(args) flow to invoke processChat before existing flags and exit if handled.
- Ensure error handling logs using logError and exits with non-zero code on failure.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- Use the existing openai dependency; add no new libraries.
- Respect existing config parsing and do not alter other CLI flags.
- Stay compatible with Node 20 and ESM standards.
- Maintain test isolation; mocks for OpenAI client should work as before.

# User Scenarios & Examples
1. Basic usage:
   - Run: node src/lib/main.js --chat 'Summarize the last 10 GitHub issues'
   - Expect: { response: 'Here is a summary of the last 10 issues...' }
2. Automated script:
   - Command: node src/lib/main.js --chat 'Translate this text to French'
   - Capture output programmatically as JSON for downstream processing.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js and sandbox/tests should include:
  - processChat returns true when flag present and prints valid JSON with response field.
  - Error scenario where OpenAI throws, logError is invoked, and process exits non-zero.
- Mock the OpenAI client to simulate a successful and a failed chat completion.
- Update README with CLI usage example for `--chat` flag.
