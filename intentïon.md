Maintained feature FETCH_PUBLIC_DATA with

Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Enable the CLI to fetch and print JSON data from a configurable public API endpoint, providing a foundational data ingestion step for building the knowledge graph of the physical world.

# Value Proposition
This feature empowers users to retrieve structured data from any HTTP JSON API directly via the sandbox CLI. It establishes a simple, reusable entry point for seeding the knowledge graph with real-world datasets, accelerating prototyping and integration of diverse data sources.

# Success Criteria & Requirements

- The CLI recognizes a new flag `--fetch <URL>` and performs an HTTP GET request to the specified endpoint.
- Response bodies are printed as formatted JSON to stdout.
- Errors during fetch must be caught and logged as structured error entries via `logError`.
- No external dependencies beyond Node.js built-in fetch; ensure compatibility with Node 20+.

# Dependencies & Constraints

- Relies on the built-in global `fetch` API available in Node.js 20 or later.
- Must not introduce new npm dependencies.
- Side effects limited to `sandbox/source/main.js` and corresponding test and README files.

# User Scenarios & Examples

1. Fetching real-time earthquake data from USGS:
   sandbox/source/main.js --fetch https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_hour.geojson

2. Pulling weather information:
   sandbox/source/main.js --fetch https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MPX/107,69/observations

# Verification & Acceptance

- Add tests in `sandbox/tests/main.test.js` mocking `fetch` to return a dummy JSON payload and assert that CLI prints it exactly.
- Verify that providing an invalid URL triggers `logError` and exits gracefully.
- Update `sandbox/README.md` with usage examples and link to MISSION.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
- `npm test` must pass all existing and new test cases.
