title:

Add HTTP API Server with /health and /digest endpoints

And description:

We need to augment `src/lib/main.js` to expose a lightweight HTTP API server using Express, enabling external systems to interact directly via REST calls. This includes the following deliverables:

1. **Source Changes (`src/lib/main.js`):**
   - Add `express` initialization using ESM imports.
   - Configure an HTTP server that listens on `process.env.DIGEST_SERVER_PORT || 3000`.
   - Implement **GET /health** that returns `200` with JSON:
     ```json
     { "status": "ok", "uptime": <process.uptime()> }
     ```
   - Implement **POST /digest** that:
     - Parses `application/json` body as a digest event.
     - Wraps the payload into an SQS-style event via `createSQSEventFromDigest`.
     - Invokes `await digestLambdaHandler(sqsEvent)`.
     - Returns `200` with JSON `{ "batchItemFailures": [...] }` based on the handler response.
   - Gracefully handle errors (return `500` with `{ "error": <message> }`).
   - Ensure ESM compatibility and maintain existing logging behavior.

2. **Tests (`tests/unit/http_api_server.test.js`):**
   - Add Vitest + Supertest tests covering:
     - **GET /health** returns correct status code, JSON shape, and increasing uptime.
     - **POST /digest** with valid payload returns an empty `batchItemFailures` array.
     - **POST /digest** with invalid JSON returns a `400` or appropriate error response.
   - Mock `digestLambdaHandler` as needed to simulate both success and failure scenarios.

3. **Documentation (`sandbox/README.md`):**
   - Document the HTTP API in a new **API** section.
   - Include endpoint descriptions, environment variable (`DIGEST_SERVER_PORT`) configuration, and example `curl` commands:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:3000/health
     curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/digest -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"key":"events/1.json","value":"12345","lastModified":"..."}'
     ```

4. **Dependencies (`package.json`):**
   - Ensure `supertest` is listed under `devDependencies` (already present).

**Verification Steps:**
- Run `npm test` and confirm all unit tests pass (including the new Supertest suite).
- Start the server with `DIGEST_SERVER_PORT=4000 npm start` and verify:
  - `GET /health` returns correct JSON.
  - `POST /digest` processes events and returns the expected `batchItemFailures` response.
