Maintained feature FETCH_PUBLIC_DATA with

Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Enable the CLI to fetch and print JSON data from a configurable public API endpoint, providing a foundational data ingestion step for building the knowledge graph of the physical world.

# Value Proposition
This feature empowers users to retrieve structured data from any HTTP JSON API directly via the sandbox CLI. It establishes a simple, reusable entry point for seeding the knowledge graph with real-world datasets, accelerating prototyping and integration of diverse data sources.

# Success Criteria & Requirements

- The CLI recognizes a new flag `--fetch <URL>` and performs an HTTP GET request to the specified endpoint.
- Response bodies are printed as formatted JSON to stdout.
- Errors during fetch must be caught and logged as structured error entries via `logError`.
- No external dependencies beyond Node.js built-in fetch; ensure compatibility with Node 20+.

# Dependencies & Constraints

- Relies on the built-in global `fetch` API available in Node.js 20 or later.
- Must not introduce new npm dependencies.
- Side effects limited to `sandbox/source/main.js` and corresponding test and README files.

# User Scenarios & Examples

1. Fetching real-time earthquake data from USGS:
   sandbox/source/main.js --fetch https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_hour.geojson

2. Pulling weather information:
   sandbox/source/main.js --fetch https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MPX/107,69/observations

# Verification & Acceptance

- Add tests in `sandbox/tests/main.test.js` mocking `fetch` to return a dummy JSON payload and assert that CLI prints it exactly.
- Verify that providing an invalid URL triggers `logError` and exits gracefully.
- Update `sandbox/README.md` with usage examples and link to MISSION.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
- `npm test` must pass all existing and new test cases.

Generated issue 1619 for feature "data-crawler" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1619

title:

Implement DATA_CRAWLER CLI to fetch and output JSON from a URL

And description:

We need to add basic data crawling functionality to the sandbox CLI so that we can fetch public data sources and begin building our knowledge graph. This issue will implement a `--crawl <url>` flag in `sandbox/source/main.js`, add tests in `sandbox/tests/main.test.js`, and update `sandbox/README.md` with usage documentation.

Changes to make:

1. Update `sandbox/source/main.js`:
   - Parse a new `--crawl` flag followed by a URL argument.
   - Use the built-in `fetch` API (Node 20 global fetch) to retrieve data from the provided URL.
   - Attempt to parse the response as JSON and `console.log` the result in stringified form.
   - Handle fetch or parsing errors by printing a JSON-formatted error object via `console.error` and exiting with a non-zero code.

2. Extend `sandbox/tests/main.test.js`:
   - Mock the global `fetch` function to return a dummy JSON payload for a fake URL.
   - Add a test case that calls `main(["--crawl", "https://example.com/data"])` and asserts that `console.log` was called with the expected JSON string.
   - Add a test case for handling a fetch error (e.g., mock `fetch` to reject) and assert that `console.error` is called and that the process exits non-zero (or simulate behavior without actual exit).

3. Update `sandbox/README.md`:
   - Document the new `--crawl` option under the CLI Usage section.
   - Provide an example invocation: `node sandbox/source/main.js --crawl https://api.example.com/data` and sample output.

4. Verification:
   - Run `npm test` and ensure all existing and new tests pass.
   - Run `npm run sandbox -- --crawl https://example.com/data` and verify JSON is printed to stdout.

Only modify the following files:
- `sandbox/source/main.js`
- `sandbox/tests/main.test.js`
- `sandbox/README.md`

This will lay the groundwork for our DATA_CRAWLER feature and enable ingestion of public JSON data sources.

LLM API Usage:
```json
{"prompt_tokens":6720,"completion_tokens":1862,"total_tokens":8582,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":1344,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
```
