## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-25T18:12:31.896Z

Maintained feature GENERATE_GRAPH.

Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Enhance the existing --graph CLI option to support persisting the generated knowledge graph to a file as well as console output. When invoked with --graph, a basic sample graph of physical world entities will be constructed and delivered in JSON format. An optional flag --output-file <path> allows the user to write the graph JSON to a specified file path for downstream processing or inspection.

# Value Proposition
Provide users both immediate feedback in the terminal and the ability to save the graph output for further analysis. This extension bridges interactive exploration and programmatic use of graph data, reducing manual copy-paste and accelerating integration with other tools.

# Requirements & Success Criteria
- Add dependency graphlib for in-memory graph construction.
- Update sandbox/source/main.js to:
  - Detect --graph flag in args.
  - Detect optional --output-file <filepath> argument following --graph.
  - Build a sample graph with at least three nodes and two edges using graphlib.
  - Serialize the graph to JSON with nodes and edges arrays.
  - If --output-file is provided, write the JSON to the specified file path, creating directories as needed.
  - If --output-file is not provided, write the JSON to stdout.
  - Exit immediately after graph output without executing other commands.
- Update sandbox/tests/main.test.js to verify:
  - Console output when no --output-file is provided.
  - File is created with correct contents when --output-file is provided.
  - Exit behavior and error handling for invalid paths.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- New dependency: graphlib.
- Use Node.js fs/promises for file operations.
- Ensure CLI parsing remains compatible with other flags.
- Maintain sandbox mode boundaries by only modifying sandbox/source and sandbox/tests.

# User Scenarios & Examples
- Interactive exploration: user runs "node sandbox/source/main.js --graph" and sees the graph JSON printed in terminal.
- Programmatic use: user runs "node sandbox/source/main.js --graph --output-file ./graph.json" and then inspects the file graph.json to load into other tools.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Automated tests confirm JSON output contains nodes and edges arrays with sample values.
- File writing tests confirm the JSON written matches expected structure.
- CLI exits gracefully after output operations.
- No regression in existing sandbox tests and main CLI behavior remains unchanged when flags are absent.

## Feature to Issue at 2025-05-25T18:12:47.063Z

Generated issue 1617 for feature "generate-graph" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1617

title:

Add --graph CLI option to generate a sample knowledge graph in JSON

And description:

This issue implements the `GENERATE_GRAPH` feature by adding a `--graph` flag to the sandbox CLI. When invoked, it will build a simple in-memory knowledge graph using `graphlib` and print a JSON representation of nodes and edges, then exit without running other commands.

Scope of work:

1. **Update Dependencies**
   - In `package.json`, add `graphlib` (e.g., `"graphlib": "^2.1.8"`) under `dependencies`.

2. **Implement CLI Flag**
   - In `sandbox/source/main.js`:
     - Parse `args` for `--graph`.
     - If present, import `{ Graph }` from `graphlib`.
     - Build a sample graph with at least three nodes (`A`, `B`, `C`) and two edges (`A -> B`, `B -> C`).
     - Construct an object `{ nodes: [...], edges: [{ from, to }, ...] }` from the graph.
     - Output the JSON via `console.log(JSON.stringify(graphData, null, 2))` and call `process.exit(0)`.
     - Ensure no other CLI logic runs when `--graph` is provided.

3. **Add Automated Tests**
   - In `sandbox/tests/main.test.js`:
     - Add a new test case that mocks `console.log` using Vitestâ€™s `vi.spyOn`, invokes `main(["--graph"])`, and captures the output.
     - Parse the printed JSON and assert:
       - It has `nodes` and `edges` arrays.
       - `nodes` contains `["A","B","C"]`.
       - `edges` contains objects `{ from: "A", to: "B" }` and `{ from: "B", to: "C" }`.
       - Only one `console.log` call occurs.

4. **Update Documentation**
   - In `sandbox/README.md`:
     - Add a `## CLI Usage` section or update the existing one to include `--graph`.
     - Provide a short description and example of the JSON output.

**Verification Steps:**

- Run `npm install` to include `graphlib`.
- Execute `npm test`; new and existing tests should pass.
- Run `node sandbox/source/main.js --graph`; verify a pretty-printed JSON object appears with `nodes` and `edges` as specified and the process exits.

By completing these changes in one combined update (dependency, source, tests, and docs), we deliver the core `GENERATE_GRAPH` functionality and ensure it is covered and documented.

## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-25T18:13:09.813Z

Maintained feature CRAWL_PUBLIC_DATA.

Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Add a new CLI option --crawl to sandbox/source/main.js that retrieves data from a public API and incorporates it into the existing knowledge graph representation.

# Value Proposition
Provide a concrete demonstration of crawling a real-world public data source and show users how external data enriches the graph. Establish groundwork for scalable data ingestion from multiple APIs in future iterations.

# Requirements
- Add a dependency on node-fetch for HTTP requests.
- Update sandbox/source/main.js to detect the --crawl flag and accept an entity name argument (for example --crawl Earth).
- When --crawl is invoked:
  - Construct a URL to fetch the Wikipedia summary for the given entity using the REST API endpoint.
  - Perform an HTTP GET request and parse the JSON response to extract title, description, and page URL.
  - Build a graph node for the entity with properties title, description, and url.
  - Merge this new node into a sample graph containing at least two existing nodes and one edge.
  - Output the combined graph as a JSON object with nodes and edges arrays.
  - Exit immediately after output.
- Write tests in sandbox/tests to mock fetch responses and verify that the resulting graph JSON contains the expected node and edge structures.

# User Scenarios
- A user runs node sandbox/source/main.js --crawl Earth and sees a JSON object listing nodes including Earth with its description and URL, and edges between Earth and sample nodes.
- CI pipeline runs tests that simulate fetch of a known summary and assert the graph output matches the expected structure.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Automated tests confirm that when fetch returns a sample summary, the graph JSON includes a node with id matching the entity name and correct properties.
- Tests verify the merge of crawled data into the existing sample graph without altering the original graph format.
- Console output is valid JSON and the CLI process exits with no errors.
