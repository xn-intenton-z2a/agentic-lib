# Mission Statement

**agentic‑lib** Is a JavaScript library which can be used as a drop in JS implementation or wholesale replacement for 
the steps, jobs, and re-usable workflows below in this repository. It is designed to be used in a GitHub Actions 
workflow to enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate
through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be
invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

Maintained feature HTTP_SERVER.

Feature spec:

# HTTP Server Support

## Overview
Enable the library to stand up an HTTP server for real-time digest ingestion and health checks. This allows agentic workflows or external systems to send events directly over HTTP instead of only via CLI or SQS simulation.

## API Endpoints

### POST /digest
Accepts a JSON payload representing a digest object. Forwards the payload to the existing digestLambdaHandler. Returns 200 and an object listing any failed record identifiers.

### GET /health
Returns basic health information including server status and uptime. Responds with 200 and a JSON object { status: "ok", uptime: <seconds> }.

## Configuration

- PORT (number, default 3000): Port the HTTP server listens on.
- GITHUB_API_BASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY: Inherited from existing environment config.

## Logging & Error Handling

Use existing logInfo and logError utilities for request and error logs. Validate incoming JSON body for the /digest endpoint, return 400 if the payload is missing or invalid. All errors must produce JSON responses with an error message and appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Implementation Details

- Modify sandbox/source/main.js (or src/lib/main.js when building sandbox) to import express and start the server when --serve or when environment variable ENABLE_HTTP_SERVER is true.
- On startup, log server listen events and errors.

## Testing & Verification

- Add tests in sandbox/tests/http-server.test.js using supertest to verify:
  - POST /digest with valid payload returns success structure with empty failures.
  - POST /digest with malformed JSON returns 400 and error message.
  - GET /health returns status ok and a numeric uptime.
- Include tests in existing vitest setup and run via npm test.

## Documentation

- Update sandbox/README.md to document HTTP server usage, environment variables, and example curl commands for /digest and /health endpoints.
- Add API reference section detailing request and response schemas.

## Dependencies

- Confirm express is listed in package.json; add supertest to devDependencies for testing if not already present.
