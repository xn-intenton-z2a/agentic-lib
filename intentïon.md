Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Define a new CLI flag --crawl that accepts one or more URLs, fetches each resource using the Node 20 fetch API, and converts each response into a standardized SQS event for downstream processing.

# Value Proposition
Enables direct ingestion of external data sources into the existing event pipeline. Simplifies the initial crawling step and provides a unified interface for retrieving remote content, laying the groundwork for building the knowledge graph of the physical world.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- Recognize a --crawl flag in the CLI and parse a comma-separated list of URLs supplied as the next argument.
- For each URL:
  - Use fetch to retrieve the resource.
  - Construct a digest object with fields url, status, body, and timestamp.
  - Invoke createSQSEventFromDigest to wrap the digest in an SQS event.
  - Call digestLambdaHandler with the generated event.
  - Log an info entry for each successful fetch.
  - On fetch failure or non-2xx status, log an error entry including URL, status or error message, and continue processing remaining URLs.
- Return true from processCrawl to signal that the flag was handled and terminate further CLI processing.

# Testability & Stability
- Unit tests mock global fetch to simulate successful and failed HTTP responses.
- Verify that createSQSEventFromDigest and digestLambdaHandler are called with the correct digest structure.
- Assert that logInfo contains expected URL and timestamp fields on success.
- Assert that logError is called with descriptive error messages on failure.
- Confirm that main exits early when --crawl is present and does not process other CLI flags.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- No additional dependencies; rely on built-in Node 20 fetch API.
- Leverage existing utilities: createSQSEventFromDigest, digestLambdaHandler, logInfo, and logError.
- Changes limited to src/lib/main.js, relevant test files under tests/unit, sandbox/source/main.js, and sandbox/tests.

# User Scenarios & Examples
- Single URL: node src/lib/main.js --crawl https://example.com/data.json
- Multiple URLs: node src/lib/main.js --crawl https://a.com,https://b.org
- Confirm console output of JSON-encoded SQS events and log entries for each URL.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Use vitest to run new tests under tests/unit and sandbox/tests.
- Manual confirmation that CLI invocation with real URLs produces valid SQS event objects and error logs.
- Code review verifies adherence to project style, ESM standards, and existing logging conventions.

Generated issue 1654 for feature "crawl-command" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1654

title:

Implement --crawl CLI flag to fetch URLs and produce SQS events

And description:

Overview:\n
Add a new --crawl command to the CLI that accepts one or more comma-separated URLs, fetches each resource using the built-in Node 20 fetch API, converts each response into a standard SQS event, and invokes the existing digest pipeline. This completes the CRAWL_COMMAND feature and enables direct ingestion of external data sources into our event-driven architecture.\n\nTasks:\n1. src/lib/main.js\n   - Create an async function processCrawl(args) that:  
     • Detects the presence of "--crawl" in the args list.  
     • Reads the next argument as a comma-separated list of URLs.  
     • For each URL:  
       - Calls fetch(url) and awaits the response.  
       - Builds a digest object: { url, status: response.status, body: await response.text(), timestamp: new Date().toISOString() }.  
       - Wraps it via createSQSEventFromDigest and calls await digestLambdaHandler(event).  
       - Logs success via logInfo including URL and timestamp.  
       - On fetch error or non-2xx status, logs an error via logError(URL, error/status) and continues.  
     • Returns true when "--crawl" is handled, to short-circuit main.  
   - In the main(args) flow, call processCrawl(args) immediately after processDigest; if it returns true, exit early.\n\n2. tests/unit/main-crawl.test.js\n   - Mock global.fetch to simulate:  
     • A successful 200 response containing fixed body text.  
     • A failing 404 response and a network rejection.  
   - Spy on createSQSEventFromDigest, digestLambdaHandler, logInfo, and logError.  
   - Verify on success: correct digest fields, calls to event creation and handler, and logInfo calls.  
   - Verify on failure: logError is called with the correct URL and error/status, and processing continues through all URLs.  
   - Assert that processCrawl returns true.\n\n3. sandbox/README.md\n   - Document the new --crawl flag, its usage examples (single and multiple URLs), and expected console output.\n\nVerification:\n- Run `npm test` and confirm all existing tests pass plus the new main-crawl.test.js.\n- Manually invoke `node src/lib/main.js --crawl https://example.com/data.json,https://httpstat.us/404` and observe:  
  • JSON-encoded SQS events logged for successful URLs.  
  • Error log entries for failed URLs.  
  • Process exits cleanly after processing all URLs.
