Maintained feature HELLO_COMMAND with

Feature spec:

# Hello Command

## Objective & Scope
Implement a new CLI flag --hello and default no-argument behavior that prints the message Hello World to the console. This feature will reside in sandbox/source/main.js and adjust tests and documentation accordingly.

## Value Proposition
Provides users a simple way to output Hello World, aligning with the mission and serving as a demonstration of basic CLI functionality and library usage.

## Success Criteria & Requirements
- When the CLI is invoked with --hello, the console outputs Hello World! exactly.
- When the CLI is invoked with no arguments, it also outputs Hello World! and then exits without error.
- Existing flags --help, --version, and --digest continue to function unchanged.
- Tests cover both the --hello flag and default invocation.

## Dependencies & Constraints
- No new external dependencies are introduced.
- Changes confined to sandbox/source/main.js, sandbox/tests/main.test.js, and sandbox/README.md.

## User Scenarios & Examples
Scenario 1: User runs npx sandbox/source/main.js --hello
  The CLI prints Hello World! and exits.

Scenario 2: User runs npx sandbox/source/main.js with no flags
  The CLI prints Hello World! and exits.

## Verification & Acceptance
- Add tests in sandbox/tests/main.test.js to assert process output for --hello and no flags.
- Manually run npm run sandbox to verify the output.

Generated issue 1662 for feature "hello-command" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1662

title:

Implement --hello flag and default no-arg behavior to print "Hello World!" in sandbox CLI

And description:

This issue completes the HELLO_COMMAND feature by updating the sandbox CLI (sandbox/source/main.js), its tests, and README to print `Hello World!` when invoked with `--hello` or no arguments. It preserves the existing structure and adds:  

1. **sandbox/source/main.js**  
   - Detect `--hello` in `args` or an empty `args` array.  
   - Print exactly `Hello World!` (with exclamation) and exit.  
   - For any other flags, delegate to the original behavior or exit gracefully.  

2. **sandbox/tests/main.test.js**  
   - Add two tests capturing `console.log` output:  
     - Invoke `main` with `[

## Issue to enhanced Issue at 2025-05-26T23:45:42.066Z

Activity:

Updated feature development issue https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/ with enhanced description:

This issue completes the HELLO_COMMAND feature by updating the sandbox CLI (`sandbox/source/main.js`), its tests, and the README to print `Hello World!` when invoked with `--hello` or with no arguments. It preserves existing behavior for other flags.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. CLI Behavior:
   - When running `node sandbox/source/main.js --hello`, the process prints exactly `Hello World!` to stdout and exits with code 0.
   - When running `node sandbox/source/main.js` with no arguments, the process prints exactly `Hello World!` to stdout and exits with code 0.
   - When other flags (e.g., `--help`, `--version`, `--digest`) are provided, existing behaviors are unchanged.

2. Test Coverage:
   - Add two tests in `sandbox/tests/main.test.js` that mock or capture `console.log`:
     a. Assert that invoking `main(['--hello'])` logs `Hello World!`.
     b. Assert that invoking `main([])` logs `Hello World!`.
   - Ensure tests fail if the output is anything other than the exact string with exclamation mark.

3. Documentation:
   - Update `sandbox/README.md` to include the new `--hello` flag and default no-argument behavior under the Usage section.
   - Provide a clear example invocation for both cases.

4. Ensure all existing tests pass and follow repository coding and formatting conventions.

LLM API Usage:
```json
{"prompt_tokens":6691,"completion_tokens":869,"total_tokens":7560,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":512,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
```
