## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-25T01:42:17.773Z

Maintained feature NUMBER_GUESS_GAME.

Feature spec:

# Objective
Implement a fully interactive console-based number guessing game with configurable range and clear user guidance.

# Scope
- Modify sandbox/source/main.js to implement the game loop using Node’s built-in readline module.
- Accept optional CLI flags `--min` and `--max` to configure the guessing range (defaults 1 to 100).
- Track and display the number of attempts taken once the user guesses correctly.
- Enhance sandbox/tests/main.test.js to simulate user input sequences covering typical and edge cases, validating prompt text and feedback messages.
- Update sandbox/README.md to document installation, CLI usage (including flags), game instructions, and example sessions.
- Do not add or delete files; only source, tests, and README will be updated.

# Value Proposition
- Delivers a self-contained, engaging CLI experience demonstrating input parsing, I/O handling, and control flow.
- Provides a clear example of configurable command-line tools in Node.js following ESM standards.
- Lays foundation for future sandbox features by showcasing testing patterns for interactive CLI applications.

# Requirements & Success Criteria
- On launch, display a welcome message, instructions, and the current guessing range.
- Correctly parse and validate numeric `--min` and `--max` flags; handle invalid ranges with an error message and exit code 1.
- Randomly select an integer between the inclusive lower and upper bounds.
- Prompt the user repeatedly until the correct number is entered, providing feedback: "Too low", "Too high", or "Correct!".
- Upon correct guess, display "Congratulations! You guessed the number in X attempts." and exit gracefully.
- All core logic must be covered by automated tests mocking stdin/stdout.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- Use only Node.js built-in modules (`readline`, `process`, `console`).
- Maintain compatibility with Node 20 and ESM standards.
- Avoid introducing new third-party dependencies.

# User Scenarios & Examples
- Scenario: `node sandbox/source/main.js --min 10 --max 20` displays "Guess a number between 10 and 20".
- Scenario: User guesses 15 ("Too low"), then 18 ("Too high"), then 17 ("Correct! Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.").

# Verification & Acceptance
- Unit tests simulate a sequence of out-of-range, invalid, and valid guesses asserting correct prompts and exit behavior.
- Manual acceptance: run `npm run sandbox -- --min 1 --max 5`, play the game, and verify prompt text, feedback messages, attempt counter, and exit code.
- Code review checks adherence to coding standards, test coverage, and documentation completeness.

Maintained feature NUMBER_GUESS_GAME.

Feature spec:

# Objective
Extend the existing console-based number guessing game to allow players to configure the guessing range through command-line flags, while preserving core gameplay and feedback mechanics.

# Scope
- Modify sandbox/source/main.js to parse two new optional flags: --min and --max.
- Default the lower bound to 1 and the upper bound to 100 when flags are omitted.
- Validate that both flags are integers and that min is strictly less than max; provide an error message and exit if validation fails.
- Adjust the game loop to use the configured range when selecting the secret number and when instructing the user on valid guesses.
- Enhance sandbox/tests/main.test.js to simulate game sessions with default and custom ranges, including invalid flag scenarios.
- Update sandbox/README.md to document the new flags, usage examples, and expected behavior.

# Value Proposition
- Empowers users to control game difficulty by setting a custom number range.
- Demonstrates robust CLI argument parsing and error handling in a minimal sandbox environment.
- Reinforces best practices for default values and input validation in Node-based CLI tools.

# Requirements & Success Criteria
- The CLI accepts --min and --max flags followed by integer values.
- When flags are omitted, the game functions exactly as before with range 1 to 100.
- If a flag value is missing, non-numeric, or if min is >= max, display a clear usage error and exit with a non-zero status.
- On successful launch, display a welcome message indicating the active range (e.g., "Guess a number between X and Y").
- Maintain feedback messages: "Too low", "Too high", "Correct!" and track the number of attempts.
- All new functionality is covered by automated tests that mock stdin, capture stdout, and assert exit codes for invalid flag usage.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- Use only Node.js built-in modules (process.argv, readline, console).
- No additional third-party dependencies may be introduced.
- Maintain compatibility with Node 20 and ESM standards.

# User Scenarios & Examples
- Default range: node sandbox/source/main.js
  Welcome to Number Guess! Guess a number between 1 and 100.
- Custom range: node sandbox/source/main.js --min 10 --max 20
  Welcome to Number Guess! Guess a number between 10 and 20.
- Invalid flags: node sandbox/source/main.js --min 50 --max 10
  Error: Invalid range. Ensure min (50) is less than max (10).

# Verification & Acceptance
- Tests simulate a correct-guess session for default range and for a custom range of [5, 7].
- Tests assert that invalid flag combinations output appropriate error messages and exit with status code 1.
- Manual acceptance: Run the game locally with and without flags, verify instructional messages match the configured range, confirm gameplay functions normally.

title:

Implement interactive console-based number guessing game in sandbox

And description:

Overview:

Enhance the sandbox CLI to provide a fully interactive number guessing game. The game should pick a random integer between 1 and 100, display a welcome message and instructions, prompt the user for guesses, provide feedback (“Too low”, “Too high”, or “Correct!”), count attempts, and exit when guessed correctly.

Scope of Changes:

1. **sandbox/source/main.js**
   - Import and configure Node’s built-in `readline` module.
   - On startup, display a welcome banner and instructions: “Guess a number between 1 and 100.”
   - Generate a random integer in the range [1, 100].
   - Implement a loop that:
     - Prompts the user for a numeric guess.
     - Parses the input and compares against the secret number.
     - Prints one of:
       - “Too low”
       - “Too high”
       - “Correct! You found the number in X attempts.”
     - Increments an attempt counter.
     - Closes the readline interface and exits when guessed correctly.

2. **sandbox/tests/main.test.js**
   - Replace the existing placeholder test with a simulation of user input.
   - Use a mock or child process approach to feed a sequence of guesses ending in success (e.g., 50 → 25 → 75 → secret number) via stdin.
   - Capture stdout and assert the correct sequence of prompts and feedback messages, including the final success message with the correct attempt count.

3. **sandbox/README.md**
   - Write usage instructions:
     ```bash
     npm run sandbox      # start the game
     ```
   - Describe game rules, controls, and exit behavior.
   - Provide an example playthrough transcript.

Verification & Acceptance:

- **Automated Tests:** Run `npm test`. All new tests in `sandbox/tests/main.test.js` must pass and cover:
  - Welcome message and instructions.
  - Prompting each guess.
  - Feedback messages for low, high, and correct guesses.
  - Attempt counter accuracy.
- **Manual Acceptance:** Run `npm run sandbox` and play the game to ensure prompts, feedback, and exit behavior align with the specification.

Constraints:

- Only modify `sandbox/source/main.js`, `sandbox/tests/main.test.js`, and `sandbox/README.md`.
- Do not introduce any third-party dependencies. Use only Node.js built-in modules.
- Maintain compatibility with Node 20 and ESM standards.
- Adhere to existing coding style and test conventions.

Title: Interactive Console-Based Number Guessing Game

Overview:
Provide a fully interactive CLI number-guessing game in the sandbox. On launch, the game should display a welcome banner and instructions, pick a random integer in the inclusive range [1,100], and prompt the user until they guess correctly. After each guess, the game must give immediate feedback and maintain an attempt count.

Scope of Changes:
1. sandbox/source/main.js
   - Import and configure Node’s built-in readline module.
   - On startup, display:
     • Welcome message: "Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!"
     • Instructions: "Guess a number between 1 and 100."
   - Generate a secret integer between 1 and 100.
   - Implement a loop that:
     • Prompts: "Enter your guess: "
     • Parses input as integer; ignores non-numeric input with an error prompt.
     • Compares guess to secret number and prints exactly one of:
       – "Too low"
       – "Too high"
       – "Correct! You found the number in X attempts."
     • Increments attempt counter on valid numeric guesses.
     • Closes the readline interface and exits process with code 0 when correct.

2. sandbox/tests/main.test.js
   - Replace placeholder test with an automated simulation of stdin input sequences ending in a correct guess.
   - Feed guesses (e.g. 25 → 75 → secret) and capture stdout.
   - Assert in order:
     a) Welcome message and instructions printed once.
     b) Prompt printed before each guess.
     c) Correct feedback messages ("Too low" / "Too high").
     d) Final success message includes the exact attempt count.
     e) Process exits cleanly.

3. sandbox/README.md
   - Document invocation: `npm run sandbox`
   - Describe gameplay rules, controls, and exit on correct guess.
   - Include an example transcript showing prompts, feedback, and success message.

Acceptance Criteria (Automated Tests):
- Test harness calls `main()` and simulates stdin inputs, verifying stdout contains the exact expected lines in sequence.
- Tests cover:
  • Welcome banner and instructions.
  • Prompt before each guess.
  • Feedback for low, high, and correct guesses.
  • Correct attempt count in the success message.
  • Readline interface closed and process exits with code 0.

Acceptance Criteria (Manual):
- Running `npm run sandbox` starts the game.
- Gameplay prompts and feedback match the automated tests.
- On correct guess, game prints final message with attempt count and exits without error.

Constraints:
- Only modify `sandbox/source/main.js`, `sandbox/tests/main.test.js`, and `sandbox/README.md`.
- Use only built-in Node.js modules (no new dependencies).
- Maintain Node 20 compatibility and ESM standards.
- Follow existing coding style and test conventions.

LLM API Usage:

```json
{"prompt_tokens":7217,"completion_tokens":1204,"total_tokens":8421,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":512,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}

title:

Support --min and --max flags for custom range in Number Guess Game

And description:

We need to extend the existing Number Guess Game in the sandbox to allow users to configure the guessing range via command-line flags. This involves updating the source implementation, adding comprehensive test coverage, and documenting the new CLI options.

1. **Modify sandbox/source/main.js**
   - Parse two optional flags: `--min <number>` and `--max <number>` (default to 1 and 100 when omitted).
   - Validate both values are integers and ensure `min < max`. On validation failure, print a clear error (e.g., `Error: Invalid range. Ensure min (X) is less than max (Y).`) and exit with code 1.
   - Randomly select a secret integer between `min` and `max` (inclusive).
   - Display a welcome/instruction message: `Welcome to Number Guess! Guess a number between X and Y.`
   - Implement the game loop with Node’s `readline`:
     - Prompt the user for a guess each iteration.
     - Provide feedback: “Too low”, “Too high”, or on success: `Congratulations! You guessed the number in N attempts.`
     - Exit gracefully after a correct guess.
   - Ensure all logic remains in ESM, uses only built-in modules, and maintains compatibility with Node 20.

2. **Enhance sandbox/tests/main.test.js**
   - Add tests simulating a full game session for the default range (1–100).
   - Add tests for a custom range, e.g., `--min 5 --max 7`, validating the welcome message and game flow.
   - Add tests for invalid flag usage:
     - Missing values: `--min` without a number.
     - Non-numeric values: `--max foo`.
     - Range inversion: `--min 10 --max 5`.
     - Assert that invalid scenarios print the correct error message and exit with code 1.
   - Use mocks or stubs to simulate `process.argv`, mock `stdin` input sequences, and capture `stdout` and `process.exit` behavior.

3. **Update sandbox/README.md**
   - Document installation and how to run the game: `npm run sandbox -- [--min X] [--max Y]`.
   - Describe default behavior and examples:
     ```bash
     # Default range
     npm run sandbox
     # Custom range
     npm run sandbox -- --min 10 --max 20
     ```
   - Explain error handling for invalid flags.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Running `npm run sandbox` without flags starts the game between 1 and 100.
- Running with valid flags starts the game in the specified custom range.
- Invalid flags or ranges produce an error message and exit code 1.
- All new behavior is covered by automated tests that pass via `npm test`.
- Documentation in `sandbox/README.md` is clear and accurate.

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This CLI game selects a secret number between 1 and 100 and prompts you to guess it.

## Usage

```bash
npm run sandbox
```

## How to Play

- On launch, the game displays a welcome message and the guessing range.
- You will be prompted to enter your guess.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback:
  - "Too low" if your guess is less than the secret number.
  - "Too high" if your guess is greater than the secret number.
  - "Correct! You found the number in X attempts." when you guess correctly.
- The game then exits.

## Example Playthrough

```
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
Guess a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too low
Enter your guess: 75
Too high
Enter your guess: 63
Correct! You found the number in 3 attempts.
```
```
mainOutput:
