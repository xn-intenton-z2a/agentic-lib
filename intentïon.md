## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-25T02:20:28.198Z

Maintained feature METRICS_ENDPOINT.

Feature spec:

# Objective

Expose an HTTP endpoint at path /metrics that returns runtime metrics for the service in JSON format

# Value Proposition

Enable operators and monitoring systems to gather key performance indicators such as total requests served, current process uptime, CPU and memory usage, and help with autoscaling, alerting, and capacity planning without relying on external tooling.

# Requirements

- Extend the existing Express HTTP server
- Read the port from environment variable METRICS_PORT or use HEALTH_PORT fallback
- Track total number of HTTP requests received since service start
- Respond to GET /metrics with JSON object containing:
  - requestCount: number of HTTP requests served since launch
  - uptime: process uptime in seconds
  - memoryUsage: RSS, heapTotal, heapUsed (from process.memoryUsage())

# Success Criteria & Requirements

- GET /metrics returns HTTP status code 200
- Response JSON has keys requestCount, uptime, memoryUsage
- memoryUsage is an object with keys rss, heapTotal, heapUsed as numeric values

# User Scenarios & Examples

- As an operator I can curl http://localhost:METRICS_PORT/metrics to view current metrics
- As a Prometheus exporter I can scrape /metrics endpoint periodically for custom metrics

# Verification & Acceptance

- Write unit tests to start server on an ephemeral port and assert GET /metrics returns correct status and JSON shape
- Update sandbox/tests to cover /metrics endpoint behavior
- Update sandbox/README.md with usage and example curl command

Generated issue 1606 for feature "health-endpoint" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1606

title:

Implement /health HTTP endpoint and --serve flag for sandbox CLI

And description:

## Summary

Add a built-in health check HTTP endpoint to the sandbox CLI and a new `--serve` flag to start an Express server. This will allow operators and orchestration systems to verify that the process is alive without running CLI commands.

## Changes to Apply

### 1. sandbox/source/main.js
- Install and import `express`.
- Implement a helper `createHealthServer()` that:
  - Reads `process.env.HEALTH_PORT` (default `3000`).
  - Defines `GET /health` responding with JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "ok",
      "uptime": <process.uptime() in seconds>,
      "timestamp": "<new Date().toISOString()>"
    }
    ```
- Update the CLI to handle a new `--serve` flag:
  - If `--serve` is present, call `createHealthServer().listen(port)` and log a startup message.
  - Exit after server shutdown is signaled (e.g., SIGINT).
- Export `createHealthServer` (or the `app`) for testing.

### 2. sandbox/tests/main.test.js
- Install and import `supertest`.
- Import `createHealthServer` (or the exported `app`) from `sandbox/source/main.js`.
- Add a new `describe("Health Endpoint")` block:
  - Spin up the app with `supertest(app)`.
  - Test that `GET /health` returns HTTP 200, JSON content type, and an object with keys:
    - `status` strictly equal to `'ok'`.
    - `uptime` as a number greater than or equal to `0`.
    - `timestamp` matching an ISO timestamp regex.

### 3. sandbox/README.md
- Add a section **Health Endpoint**:
  - Explain the `--serve` flag:
    ```bash
    HEALTH_PORT=4000 node sandbox/source/main.js --serve
    ```
  - Show `curl http://localhost:4000/health` sample output.

## Verification & Acceptance

1. Run existing tests to ensure no regressions:  `npm test` should pass both unit and sandbox tests.
2. New test suite under `sandbox/tests/main.test.js` must include the `/health` checks and pass.
3. Manual Smoke Test:
   ```bash
   HEALTH_PORT=4001 node sandbox/source/main.js --serve
   curl http://localhost:4001/health | jq .
   # Expect: {
   #   "status": "ok",
   #   "uptime": <number>,
   #   "timestamp": "<ISO string>"
   # }
   ```

{"prompt_tokens":6936,"completion_tokens":1801,"total_tokens":8737,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":1152,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}

Generated issue 1607 for feature "metrics-endpoint" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1607

title:

Implement /metrics HTTP endpoint with request count and runtime metrics

And description:

We need to extend the existing Express HTTP server in `sandbox/source/main.js` to track incoming requests and expose a `/metrics` endpoint returning key runtime metrics in JSON format. This will enable operators to curl or scrape `GET /metrics` on the metrics port and retrieve a structured object containing `requestCount`, `uptime`, and `memoryUsage` (`rss`, `heapTotal`, `heapUsed`).

**Changes to apply:**

1. **Source (`sandbox/source/main.js`):**
   • Import and initialize an Express app.
   • Read `METRICS_PORT` from environment (fallback to `HEALTH_PORT`).
   • Maintain a module‐scoped `requestCount` that increments on every HTTP request via a simple middleware: `app.use(...)`.
   • Define `GET /metrics` handler to respond with `{ requestCount, uptime, memoryUsage }`, where `uptime` is `process.uptime()` in seconds, and `memoryUsage` is `process.memoryUsage()` filtered to keys `rss`, `heapTotal`, `heapUsed`.
   • Export the Express `app` for testing and a `startServer()` function (or similar) called when running the CLI with `--serve` (reuse the server logic from the health implementation).

2. **Tests (`sandbox/tests/main.test.js`):**
   • Use `supertest` to import the exported `app` and perform an HTTP request against `/metrics`.
   • Write assertions to ensure:
     - Status code is `200`.
     - Response body is an object with numeric `requestCount` (initially `0` or `>=0`), numeric `uptime`, and a nested object `memoryUsage` containing numeric keys `rss`, `heapTotal`, `heapUsed`.

3. **README (`sandbox/README.md`):**
   • Document the new `/metrics` endpoint under a “Serving Metrics” section.
   • Show how to run the server (e.g. `node sandbox/source/main.js --serve`) and how to curl:
     ```bash
     METRICS_PORT=4000 node sandbox/source/main.js --serve
     curl http://localhost:4000/metrics
     ```

**Verification & Acceptance:**
- Run `npm test` and confirm the new metrics‐endpoint tests pass.
- Manually run the sandbox CLI with `METRICS_PORT` (or `HEALTH_PORT`) and hit `/metrics` to see a valid JSON response with the required shape and numeric values.

## License

See [LICENSE.md](../LICENSE.md) for license details.

## Usage

To run the sandbox CLI without serving HTTP:

```bash
node sandbox/source/main.js
```

## Health Endpoint

You can start an HTTP server to expose a `/health` endpoint for liveness checks:

```bash
HEALTH_PORT=4000 node sandbox/source/main.js --serve
```

Once started, perform a health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
# Expected JSON response:
# {
#   "status": "ok",
#   "uptime": 12.34,
#   "timestamp": "2025-05-25T02:30:00.000Z"
# }
```
