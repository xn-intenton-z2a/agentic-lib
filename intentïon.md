# Mission Statement

**agentic‑lib** Is a JavaScript library which can be used as a drop in JS implementation or wholesale replacement for 
the steps, jobs, and re-usable workflows below in this repository. It is designed to be used in a GitHub Actions 
workflow to enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate
through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be
invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

Maintained feature HTTP_SERVER.

Feature spec:

# Overview
Add an HTTP server module to expose core functionality via REST endpoints. Leverage the existing express dependency and integrate with digestLambdaHandler to allow event processing over HTTP.

# API Endpoints

1. GET /health
   - Returns HTTP 200 with JSON payload { status: "ok" } to confirm server is running.

2. POST /events
   - Accepts a JSON body representing an SQS event or a single record.
   - Invokes digestLambdaHandler with the parsed event payload.
   - Returns HTTP 200 with JSON payload from digestLambdaHandler, including any batchItemFailures and handler identification.

# CLI Integration

- Introduce a new flag `--serve` in main CLI.
- When `--serve` is supplied, start the express server on port specified by `HTTP_PORT` environment variable or default to 3000.
- Ensure process remains alive and logs server start information via logInfo.

# Tests

- Create tests using supertest in sandbox/tests/http.server.test.js.
- Test that GET /health returns 200 and correct JSON.
- Test that POST /events with valid payload triggers digestLambdaHandler and returns expected structure.
- Simulate a malformed JSON body and verify a 400 Bad Request response.

# Success Criteria

- Running `node sandbox/source/main.js --serve` starts the HTTP server on the correct port.
- Endpoints behave as specified and integrate with existing handler logic.
- All new routes and behaviors are covered by automated tests and pass under `npm test`.
