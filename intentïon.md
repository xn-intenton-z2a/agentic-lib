Maintained feature HTTP_API_SERVER.

Feature spec:

# HTTP API Server
Provide an Express based HTTP server to receive digest events over HTTP, forward them to digestLambdaHandler for processing

# Routes

- GET /health
  - Returns status code 200 and JSON { status: "OK" }
- POST /digest
  - Expects a JSON body representing a digest object
  - Validates required fields key, value, and lastModified
  - Invokes digestLambdaHandler with a synthetic SQS event
- GET /metrics
  - Returns Prometheus-style metrics for server performance and error counts

# Configuration

- PORT environment variable controls server listen port, default 3000
- API_KEY environment variable for request authentication
- METRICS_ENABLED environment variable to enable or disable /metrics endpoint

# Authentication

- All POST /digest requests must include an X-API-Key header matching API_KEY
- Requests missing or with invalid API key receive 401 Unauthorized

# Metrics

- Track total request count, successful processing count, failure count, and processing durations
- Expose metrics in text format at GET /metrics when METRICS_ENABLED is true

# Graceful Shutdown

- Listen for SIGINT and SIGTERM signals
- On signal, stop accepting new connections
- Wait for in-flight requests to complete with configurable timeout
- Log shutdown progress and exit with status code 0

# Logging and Error Handling

- Log incoming requests and responses with logInfo
- Log authentication failures and processing errors with logError
- Return structured JSON error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

# Testing and Verification

- Use supertest to cover GET /health, GET /metrics, POST /digest with valid payload, invalid payload, missing or bad API_KEY, and simulated handler errors
- Verify server starts and listens on configured port
- Ensure metrics endpoint returns correct metrics when enabled and returns 404 when disabled
- Run tests under sandbox path using npm test
