## Feature to Issue at 2025-05-25T17:36:50.001Z

Generated issue 1615 for feature "http-server" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1615

title:

Add HTTP server support with health, metrics, and digest endpoints

And description:

Overview
--------
This feature adds HTTP server capabilities to the existing CLI and Lambda logic, enabling external systems to interact over REST. When the user runs `node src/lib/main.js --serve`, an Express server will start on a configurable port (default 3000 or overridden by `--port` or `HTTP_PORT`).

Changes to Implement
--------------------
1. **CLI Flag & Port Configuration**
   - Extend `src/lib/main.js` to parse a new `--serve` flag alongside `--port <number>`.
   - Read default port from `HTTP_PORT` environment variable or fallback to `3000`.

2. **Express Server Initialization**
   - Import and initialize Express in `src/lib/main.js` when `--serve` is passed.
   - Attach middleware to parse JSON request bodies.

3. **Endpoints**
   - **GET /health**: Return HTTP 200 and JSON `{ status: "ok" }`.
   - **GET /metrics**: Track and return JSON with properties:
     - `callCount` (global invocation count)
     - `uptime` (server uptime in seconds)
   - **POST /digest**: Accept a JSON payload matching a digest object, invoke `digestLambdaHandler` internally, and return the `batchItemFailures` response as JSON.

4. **Automated Tests**
   - Add a new test file `sandbox/tests/http_server.test.js` leveraging Supertest and Vitest.
   - Cover each endpoint:
     - Assert status codes and response shapes for `/health` and `/metrics`.
     - Simulate a valid digest POST and verify the handler is called and response includes `batchItemFailures`.
   - Ensure tests spin up and tear down the server cleanly without port conflicts.

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update `sandbox/README.md`:
     - Document the new `--serve` and `--port` options.
     - Provide curl examples for `/health`, `/metrics`, and `/digest`.
     - Note default behaviors when `--serve` is omitted.

Verification
------------
- Run `npm test` and ensure all existing and new tests pass.
- Manual smoke test:
  ```bash
  HTTP_PORT=4000 node src/lib/main.js --serve --port 5000
  curl http://localhost:5000/health
  curl http://localhost:5000/metrics
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/digest -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       -d '{ "key": "events/1.json", "value": "12345", "lastModified": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z" }'
  ```
- Confirm no regressions for existing CLI flags (`--help`, `--version`, `--digest`) when run without `--serve`.

## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-25T17:36:55.511Z

Maintained feature CLI_ENHANCEMENTS.

Feature spec:

# Objective

Provide common CLI flags in the sandbox wrapper to improve usability and align with core library behavior.

# Value Proposition

- Enables users to discover and understand available commands via a help flag without inspecting source code.
- Provides version information tied to package.json, ensuring transparency about the current release in sandbox mode.
- Retains existing behavior when no known flags are provided, preserving backwards compatibility.

# Requirements & Success Criteria

1. Update sandbox/source/main.js to detect and handle the following flags:
   - `--help`: print a usage summary showing supported flags and exit with code 0.
   - `--version`: read the version field from package.json and print it, then exit with code 0.
2. When neither `--help` nor `--version` is supplied, maintain the current behavior of printing the raw argument array.
3. Add automated tests in sandbox/tests/main.test.js or a new sandbox test file to cover:
   - Invocation with `--help` returns exit code 0 and prints a usage summary.
   - Invocation with `--version` returns exit code 0 and prints the correct version from package.json.
   - Invocation with no flags or unknown flags continues to print the argument array without error.
4. Update sandbox/README.md with examples for:
   - Running `node sandbox/source/main.js --help`.
   - Running `node sandbox/source/main.js --version`.
   - Running `node sandbox/source/main.js some arbitrary args`.
5. Ensure no additional dependencies are introduced.
6. Preserve existing sandbox/test setup so that current tests for basic termination continue to pass.

# Dependencies & Constraints

- Use ESM dynamic import or `import packageJson from '../../package.json' assert { type: 'json' }` to read version.
- Maintain Node 20 compatibility and ESM standards in sandbox/source/main.js.
- Tests should use Vitest as configured in sandbox package.json.

# User Scenarios

1. A new developer runs `node sandbox/source/main.js --help` to see available commands.
2. A CI script queries `node sandbox/source/main.js --version` to verify the deployed sandbox version.
3. An engineer experiments with sandbox CLI by passing custom arguments and observing the raw output.

# Verification & Acceptance

- All new and existing tests in sandbox/tests pass without modification to core library files.
- Manual testing confirms help and version flags behave as specified, and default behavior is unchanged.
