Maintained feature CRAWL_OPENSTREETMAP with

Feature spec:

# Objective
Enable the CLI and Lambda entrypoint to fetch structured geospatial data from OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim Search API for a given place name, transform key fields into simple subject–predicate–object triples, and emit those triples as JSON log entries for downstream ingestion into the knowledge graph.

# Value Proposition
By pulling authoritative geolocation and address data directly from OpenStreetMap, we enrich the knowledge graph with precise location coordinates and context without manual effort. Users can quickly retrieve standardized geospatial metadata for any named place to power mapping, spatial queries, and location-based analytics.

# Requirements & Constraints
- Introduce a new CLI flag `--crawl-osm PLACE_NAME` in `src/lib/main.js`.
- When invoked, send a GET request to `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json&q=PLACE_NAME` using Node 20 fetch API.
- Include a custom User-Agent header to comply with Nominatim usage policy.
- Parse the JSON response, select the first result, and extract fields: `display_name`, `lat`, `lon`, and `boundingbox`.
- Transform each extracted field into a JSON object with keys `subject`, `predicate`, and `object`, where `subject` is `PLACE_NAME`, `predicate` is the field name, and `object` is the field value (string or array as appropriate).
- Log each triple as a JSON string via `logInfo` for consistency with existing logging.
- Write unit tests in `tests/unit` to mock fetch responses and verify triple output for a sample place.
- Update the README to document the new `--crawl-osm` flag, its usage example, and expected output format.
- No new dependencies; rely on built-in fetch and existing logging utilities.

# User Scenarios
1. CLI mode: `npm run start -- --crawl-osm Berlin`
   - The tool fetches geolocation data for Berlin, logs triples for display_name, lat, lon, and boundingbox.
2. Lambda mode: embed a digest record with type `crawlOpenStreetMap` and name `Paris`; `digestLambdaHandler` routes to the new crawl function and logs triples.

# Success Criteria & Verification
- Automated tests cover at least one example place, mocking fetch to return a sample JSON and asserting correct triples are passed to `logInfo`.
- Manual CLI test prints triples for a known place name.
- README clearly documents the crawling feature with usage and sample output.

Generated issue 1630 for feature "crawl-wikipedia" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1630

title:

Implement --crawl-wikipedia CLI flag to fetch and log Wikipedia page triples

And description:

Overview
--------
Enable the existing CLI and Lambda workflow to fetch structured data from Wikipedia and emit subject–predicate–object triples as JSON log entries. This issue will add a new `--crawl-wikipedia PAGE_TITLE` flag to `src/lib/main.js`, implement a reusable `crawlWikipedia(pageTitle)` function, wire it into the CLI and Lambda handler, and add unit tests and documentation.

What to Change
--------------
1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Export a new asynchronous function `crawlWikipedia(pageTitle)` that:
     - Uses the built-in `fetch` API to GET `https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/${encodeURIComponent(pageTitle)}`.
     - Parses the JSON response and extracts `title`, `description`, and any fields under an `infobox` property if present.
     - For each extracted field, constructs a triple `{ subject: pageTitle, predicate: fieldName, object: fieldValue }` and passes `JSON.stringify(triple)` into `logInfo`.
   - Add a new CLI helper `processCrawlWikipedia(args)` that:
     - Detects `--crawl-wikipedia <PAGE_TITLE>`.
     - Calls `await crawlWikipedia(PAGE_TITLE)`.
     - Returns `true` if invoked.
   - Integrate `processCrawlWikipedia` into the main argument-processing sequence (after `processDigest`).
   - Update the `generateUsage()` string to include `--crawl-wikipedia PAGE_TITLE` with a short description.
2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Mock `global.fetch` to return a sample JSON response, e.g.:  
     ```js
     { title: "Node_js", description: "JS runtime", infobox: { designed_by: "Ryan Dahl" } }
     ```
   - Spy on `logInfo` and assert that:
     - `fetch` is called with the correct URL.
     - `logInfo` is called three times with JSON-stringified triples for `title`, `description`, and the `infobox` field.
   - Ensure `crawlWikipedia` is imported for testing.
3. **sandbox/README.md**
   - Document the new `--crawl-wikipedia PAGE_TITLE` flag under a “Usage” section.
   - Provide an example:
     ```bash
     npm run start -- --crawl-wikipedia Node_js
     ```
   - Show a sample log output with three JSON log entries for title, description, and one infobox field.

Verification
------------
- Run `npm test` to confirm the new unit test passes under `tests/unit/main.test.js` and existing tests remain green.
- Manually execute:
  ```bash
  npm run start -- --crawl-wikipedia Node_js
  ```
  - Observe three JSON log entries printed via `logInfo`, each containing a triple JSON object.
  - Confirm the `generateUsage()` help text now mentions `--crawl-wikipedia PAGE_TITLE`.

No New Dependencies
-------------------
Leverage Node 20’s built-in `fetch`; do not introduce external HTTP libraries.

Maintained feature CRAWL_WIKIDATA with

Feature spec:

# Objective
Add support to the CLI and Lambda entrypoint to fetch structured semantic data from Wikidata for a given entity label, transform key entity fields into subject–predicate–object triples, and emit those triples as JSON log entries for downstream ingestion into the knowledge graph.

# Value Proposition
By tapping into the collaboratively maintained Wikidata repository, we assign canonical identifiers, labels, descriptions, and semantic classifications to real-world entities. This enriches the knowledge graph with stable references and ontology-based relationships without manual data curation.

# Requirements & Constraints
- Introduce a new CLI flag `--crawl-wikidata ENTITY_LABEL` in `src/lib/main.js`.
- When invoked, send a GET request to the Wikidata Search API endpoint https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbsearchentities&search=ENTITY_LABEL&language=en&format=json using Node 20 fetch API and a custom User-Agent header.
- Parse the JSON response, select the first search result, and extract its `id` (e.g., Q42).
- Send a second GET request to https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/<id>.json to retrieve full entity data.
- From the entity record, extract the following fields:
  - `id` (entity Q-number)
  - English label (`labels.en.value`)
  - English description (`descriptions.en.value`)
  - All values of the `instance of` property (`claims.P31`), extracting each mainsnak datavalue id.
- For each extracted field, build a JSON object with keys `subject`, `predicate`, and `object`, where:
  - `subject` is the original ENTITY_LABEL
  - `predicate` is one of id, label, description, or instanceOf
  - `object` is the extracted value (string or array of strings).
- Log each triple as a JSON string via `logInfo` to maintain consistency with existing logging.
- Write unit tests in `tests/unit` to mock both fetch calls and verify correct triple output for a sample entity.
- Update `sandbox/README.md` to document the new `--crawl-wikidata` flag, its usage example, and expected output format.
- No new dependencies; rely on built-in fetch and existing logging utilities.

# User Scenarios
1. CLI mode: `npm run start -- --crawl-wikidata Berlin`
   - The tool searches Wikidata for "Berlin", retrieves id Q64, fetches the entity record, and logs triples for id, label, description, and instanceOf values.
2. Lambda mode: embed a digest record with type `crawlWikidata` and label `Paris`; `digestLambdaHandler` routes to the new crawl function and logs triples accordingly.

# Success Criteria & Verification
- Automated tests cover mocking of the search and entity fetch responses and assert correct triples passed to `logInfo` for a sample entity.
- Manual CLI invocation displays the expected JSON triples for a known entity label.
- README clearly documents the `--crawl-wikidata` flag, usage syntax, and sample output.

# Implement `--crawl-wikipedia` CLI flag to fetch and log Wikipedia page triples

## Overview
Enable the CLI and Lambda workflow to fetch structured data from Wikipedia’s REST API, transform key fields into subject–predicate–object triples, and emit each triple as a JSON log entry via `logInfo`.

## What to Change
1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Export an async function `crawlWikipedia(pageTitle)` that:
     - Issues a GET request to `https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/${encodeURIComponent(pageTitle)}` using built-in `fetch`.
     - Parses the JSON response and extracts:
       - `title` (string)
       - `description` (string)
       - All fields under an optional `infobox` object.
     - For each extracted field, constructs a triple with:
       ```js
       { subject: pageTitle, predicate: fieldName, object: fieldValue }
       ```
       and calls `logInfo(JSON.stringify(triple))`.
   - Add `processCrawlWikipedia(args)` to detect `--crawl-wikipedia <PAGE_TITLE>`:
     - Parse `<PAGE_TITLE>` from `args`.
     - Call `await crawlWikipedia(PAGE_TITLE)` and return `true`.
   - Integrate `processCrawlWikipedia` into the main argument handler (after `processDigest`).
   - Update `generateUsage()` to include:
     ```text
     --crawl-wikipedia PAGE_TITLE   Fetch Wikipedia summary and log triples
     ```

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Mock `global.fetch` to return a sample payload, e.g.:
     ```js
     { title: 'Node_js', description: 'JS runtime', infobox: { designed_by: 'Ryan Dahl' } }
     ```
   - Spy on `logInfo` and assert:
     - `fetch` is called once with `https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/Node_js`.
     - `logInfo` is called exactly 3 times with JSON-stringified triples for:
       1. `{ subject: 'Node_js', predicate: 'title', object: 'Node_js' }`
       2. `{ subject: 'Node_js', predicate: 'description', object: 'JS runtime' }`
       3. `{ subject: 'Node_js', predicate: 'designed_by', object: 'Ryan Dahl' }`
   - Ensure the test imports and invokes `crawlWikipedia` directly.

3. **sandbox/README.md**
   - Under a “Usage” section, document the new flag:
     ```bash
     npm run start -- --crawl-wikipedia Node_js
     ```
   - Show sample output:
     ```json
     {"level":"info","timestamp":"<ts>","message":"{\"subject\":\"Node_js\",\"predicate\":\"title\",\"object\":\"Node_js\"}"}
     {"level":"info","timestamp":"<ts>","message":"{\"subject\":\"Node_js\",\"predicate\":\"description\",\"object\":\"JS runtime\"}"}
     {"level":"info","timestamp":"<ts>","message":"{\"subject\":\"Node_js\",\"predicate\":\"designed_by\",\"object\":\"Ryan Dahl\"}"}
     ```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **CLI Invocation**: `npm run start -- --crawl-wikipedia Node_js` calls `fetch` with the correct URL and logs exactly three JSON triples via `logInfo`.
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: New tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` mock `fetch`, spy on `logInfo`, and assert call count, arguments, and payload correctness.
- [ ] **Usage Documentation**: `--crawl-wikipedia` is included in `generateUsage()` output and described in `sandbox/README.md` with example and sample output.
- [ ] **Lambda Integration**: Passing a digest record of type `crawlWikipedia` to `digestLambdaHandler` triggers `crawlWikipedia` and logs the same triples.
- [ ] **No New Dependencies**: Only Node 20’s built-in `fetch` and existing logging utilities are used.

## Verification
- Run `npm test` to confirm new unit tests pass and existing tests remain green.
- Manually execute the CLI command and verify the log output matches the sample above.
