Maintained feature CRAWL_ENTITY with

Feature spec:

# Overview

Add a new CLI option --crawl to retrieve structured summary data for a given real-world entity from the Wikipedia REST API. This feature will provide the first step in building a knowledge graph by fetching node summaries and metadata from a public data source.

# Value Proposition

This feature accelerates the creation of knowledge graph nodes by ingesting curated entity summaries directly from a reliable public API. It enables users to bootstrap or enrich their graph with authoritative descriptions and links.

# Success Criteria & Requirements

- Implement a processCrawl function in src/lib/main.js to handle the --crawl flag.
- Accept an entity name argument immediately following --crawl.
- Fetch JSON from https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/{encodedEntityName}.
- Parse the response to extract title, extract (summary), content_urls.desktop.page, and record a retrievedAt timestamp.
- On success, output a single JSON object to stdout with fields: title, extract, url, retrievedAt.
- On HTTP error or network failure, use logError to report the issue and exit gracefully with a non-zero code.
- Update package.json dependencies if necessary to support fetch (Node 20 built-in or node-fetch fallback).
- Write unit tests that mock the fetch call for both success and error scenarios.
- Update README.md to document the new CLI flag and usage examples.

# Dependencies & Constraints

- Use global fetch API provided by Node 20. If unavailable in test or older environments, add node-fetch as an optional dependency.
- Maintain ESM standards and existing coding style.
- Changes limited to src/lib/main.js, sandbox/tests, README.md, and package.json dependencies.

# User Scenarios & Examples

User invokes the CLI:

  node src/lib/main.js --crawl Eiffel Tower

Expected output on success:

  {"title":"Eiffel Tower","extract":"The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower...","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower","retrievedAt":"2025-06-01T12:34:56.789Z"}

User invokes with an invalid entity or network issue, and the tool logs an error message via logError and exits with code 1.

# Verification & Acceptance

- Unit tests cover a mocked successful fetch returning a known summary.
- Unit tests cover a failing fetch and verify logError is invoked and process exits non-zero.
- Manual test by running CLI with --crawl on a popular entity.
- README updated with flag description, usage, and example outputs.

Generated issue 1634 for feature "crawl-entity" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1634

title:

Implement --crawl CLI flag to fetch Wikipedia entity summaries

And description:

Implement the CRAWL_ENTITY feature by adding a new `--crawl` CLI option in `src/lib/main.js` that retrieves structured summary data for a given real-world entity from the Wikipedia REST API. This task should be done with the following steps:

1. **Add `processCrawl` handler:**
   - Create a new `processCrawl(args)` function in `src/lib/main.js` that checks for the presence of `--crawl` in the CLI arguments.
   - After detecting `--crawl`, read the next argument as the `entityName`. If missing, log an error via `logError` and exit with status code 1.
2. **Fetch and parse Wikipedia summary:**
   - Use the global `fetch` API (Node 20+) to GET `https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/{encodeURIComponent(entityName)}`.
   - On HTTP success (status 200), parse the JSON response and extract:
     - `title`
     - `extract` (summary)
     - `content_urls.desktop.page` as `url`
     - a new `retrievedAt` field set to `new Date().toISOString()`
   - Construct a result object with these four fields and `console.log(JSON.stringify(result))` to stdout.
3. **Error handling:**
   - On non-200 HTTP responses or network errors, invoke `logError` with a descriptive message and the error object, then `process.exit(1)`.
4. **Fallback for environments without global fetch:**
   - Detect if `globalThis.fetch` is undefined, and if so import `node-fetch` dynamically and assign it to `globalThis.fetch`. Add `node-fetch` as an optional dependency in `package.json` under `dependencies`.
5. **Unit tests:**
   - In `tests/unit/`, write tests for `processCrawl`:
     - Mock `global.fetch` to simulate a successful JSON response and verify stdout JSON contains the correct fields and values.
     - Mock `global.fetch` to simulate an HTTP error (e.g., 404) and verify `logError` is called and `process.exit` is invoked.
   - In `sandbox/tests/`, add a basic smoke test invoking `sandbox/source/main.js --crawl "Test Entity"` to ensure the handler runs without throwing.
6. **Documentation:**
   - Update `sandbox/README.md` to document the new `--crawl <entityName>` flag, include usage examples and sample output.
   - In the top-level `README.md` (if mirrored), add a section under CLI usage describing `--crawl`.
7. **Verification steps:**
   - Run `npm test` and ensure all new and existing tests pass.
   - Manually run `npm start -- --crawl Eiffel Tower` and confirm output is valid JSON with `title`, `extract`, `url`, and `retrievedAt`.

Deliverables:
- Updated `src/lib/main.js`
- New/updated tests in `tests/unit/` and `sandbox/tests/`
- `package.json` updated with `node-fetch` fallback
- Updated README(s) with `--crawl` documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CLI supports `--crawl <entityName>` and prints the correct JSON summary.
- Errors are logged via `logError` and exit with code 1.
- Comprehensive unit tests cover success and error scenarios.
- Documentation reflects new functionality.

Maintained feature SERVE_API with

Feature spec:

# Overview

Add a new CLI option --serve to launch an HTTP API server that provides endpoints for fetching entity summaries and relation triples. This feature extends the CLI tool to offer a programmable HTTP interface for building and querying the knowledge graph.

# Value Proposition

This feature enables users and downstream applications to integrate knowledge graph data in real time via RESTful endpoints. It provides a simple, always-on service that wraps existing crawl functionality, lowering the barrier for automation and orchestration in data pipelines.

# Success Criteria & Requirements

- Add a processServe function in src/lib/main.js to handle the --serve flag and optional port argument.
- Use express to start an HTTP server on the specified port (default 3000).  
- Define GET /entity endpoint that accepts query parameter name and internally calls processCrawl to fetch summary.  
- Define GET /relations endpoint that accepts query parameter name and internally calls processRelations to fetch relation triples.  
- On success, respond with JSON and HTTP 200.  
- On missing or invalid query, respond with HTTP 400 and error JSON.  
- On internal error, respond with HTTP 500 and log error via logError.  
- Write unit tests using supertest to cover server startup, valid requests, missing parameters, and error handling.  
- Update README.md to document the new --serve flag, port option, endpoints, parameters, and examples.

# Dependencies & Constraints

- Introduce express as a dependency (already present) and supertest in devDependencies.  
- Maintain ESM standards and existing code style.  
- Changes limited to src/lib/main.js, sandbox/tests, tests/unit, README.md, and package.json if needed for scripts.

# User Scenarios & Examples

A user starts the server on default port:  
node src/lib/main.js --serve  
Then fetch an entity summary:  
curl http://localhost:3000/entity?name=Eiffel Tower  
Fetch relations for an entity:  
curl http://localhost:3000/relations?name=Berlin

# Verification & Acceptance

- Unit tests start the server in test mode and use supertest to call endpoints.  
- Tests cover valid name requests for /entity and /relations and verify JSON schema.  
- Tests cover missing query parameter and confirm HTTP 400 and error response.  
- Tests simulate internal fetch errors and confirm HTTP 500 and error logged.  
- Manual test by running server and making HTTP requests with browser or curl.  
- README updated with flag description, endpoints, parameters, and example requests.

Implement a new `--crawl <entityName>` CLI option in `src/lib/main.js` to fetch a structured summary of a real-world entity from the Wikipedia REST API. 

Acceptance Criteria (Testable):
1. **Success Path**
   - Running `node src/lib/main.js --crawl Eiffel Tower` should:
     - Invoke `fetch('https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/Eiffel%20Tower')`.
     - Parse the JSON response and output to stdout a single JSON object containing exactly these keys:
       - `title` (string) – non-empty.
       - `extract` (string) – non-empty summary text.
       - `url` (string) – valid URL from `content_urls.desktop.page`.
       - `retrievedAt` (string) – valid ISO timestamp within 5 seconds of the call time.
     - Exit with code `0`.
2. **Missing Entity Name**
   - Running `node src/lib/main.js --crawl` (without `<entityName>`) should:
     - Call `logError()` with a message indicating the missing entity argument.
     - Exit the process with code `1`.
3. **HTTP Error or Network Failure**
   - When `fetch` returns a non-200 status or throws an error:
     - `logError()` is invoked with a descriptive message and the original error.
     - The process exits with code `1`.
4. **Fetch Fallback**
   - If `globalThis.fetch` is undefined (e.g., older Node versions), dynamically import `node-fetch` and assign it to `globalThis.fetch` before making the API call.
   - Verify in tests that when `globalThis.fetch` is removed, the fallback correctly loads and succeeds.
5. **Unit Tests**
   - In `tests/unit/`: Mock `global.fetch` for:
     a. A successful 200 response containing known values, asserting `console.log` output matches expected JSON fields.
     b. A failed response (e.g., 404), asserting `logError` is called and `process.exit(1)` occurs.
   - In `sandbox/tests/`: A smoke test that runs `sandbox/source/main.js --crawl "Test Entity"` and verifies no uncaught exceptions.
6. **Documentation**
   - Update `sandbox/README.md` to include a section for `--crawl <entityName>` with usage examples and sample output.
   - Confirm `npm test` passes all new and existing tests.
   - Confirm manual invocation `npm start -- --crawl Eiffel Tower` produces valid JSON output.

These acceptance criteria ensure measurable user value by verifying the CLI extension integrates correctly with the Wikipedia API, handles errors gracefully, and is fully tested and documented.
