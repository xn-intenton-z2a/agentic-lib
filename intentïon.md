Mission [Implement a `--countdown` flag that displays an ASCII art countdown (3, 2, 1, Go!) using figlet in the sandbox CLI] as mentioned in reply [Hello @Antony-at-Polycode,

Great idea! Let’s reset the sandbox CLI with a fresh mission to implement a fun ASCII art countdown timer. We’ll add a new `--countdown` flag that, when invoked via `npm run sandbox -- --countdown`, uses our existing `figlet` dependency to display:

  3
  2
  1
  Go!

This will give us a visual, text-based demo of sequential ASCII art output. I’m seeding the repository now with this mission so we have a clean foundation for the countdown feature. After seeding, you can run the new countdown and we’ll iterate on timing, formatting, or extra options as needed.

Proceeding with reseed now!]
