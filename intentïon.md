# Mission Statement

**agentic‑lib** Is a JavaScript library which can be used as a drop in JS implementation or wholesale replacement for 
the steps, jobs, and re-usable workflows below in this repository. It is designed to be used in a GitHub Actions 
workflow to enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate
through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be
invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

+# HTTP Endpoint Feature
+
+# Description
+Provide an integrated HTTP server that exposes the existing digestLambdaHandler as a RESTful endpoint. Users can send POST requests to trigger the same processing logic used in the CLI and AWS Lambda contexts.
+
+# Value Proposition
+Deliver a direct HTTP API to invoke digest logic without requiring AWS infrastructure or CLI commands. Simplifies local development, testing, and integration with external services.
+
+# Success Criteria & Requirements
+- Launch an HTTP server when invoked with the --serve flag.
+- Default to port 3000 or honor the PORT environment variable.
+- Accept POST requests at the /digest endpoint with a JSON body matching the SQS event schema.
+- Return HTTP 200 with a JSON body listing any batchItemFailures.
+- Graceful shutdown on SIGINT or SIGTERM.
+
+# API Specification
+Endpoint: POST /digest
+Request Body: JSON object with either Records array or single event record. Matches SQS event format.
+Response:
+  status: 200
+  body: { batchItemFailures: Array }
+
+# CLI Integration
+Extend main() to process a new --serve flag:
+  node src/lib/main.js --serve [--port <number>]
+When --serve is present, start HTTP server instead of running CLI commands.
+
+# Verification & Acceptance
+- Unit tests simulate POST /digest requests and validate JSON responses.
+- Tests cover valid and invalid JSON payloads and error handling.
+- Manual test using curl or HTTP client to verify behavior.
```
