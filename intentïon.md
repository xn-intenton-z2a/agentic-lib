Feature spec:

# HTTP API Service

## Objective & Scope
Provide an HTTP API for submitting digest events and health checks. Implement a new CLI flag `--serve` in the core application to spin up an Express server that listens for HTTP requests. Clients can POST digest payloads to `/digest` and verify service availability via `/health`. This service will run in the same process as CLI and reuse existing digest handler logic.

## Value Proposition
- Enables remote systems to push data for processing without requiring SQS or AWS infrastructure.
- Simplifies integration and testing by providing a local HTTP endpoint.
- Extends the core CLI tool into a lightweight HTTP service for rapid prototyping and integration.

## Requirements & Dependencies
- Extend `src/lib/main.js` to import and configure Express.
- Add a new CLI flag `--serve` processed in `main` to start the HTTP server.
- Default port should be configurable via environment variable `HTTP_API_PORT`, defaulting to 3000.
- Add health check endpoint `/health` that returns status JSON `{"status":"ok"}`.
- Add digest endpoint `/digest` expecting JSON body representing a digest, forwarding it to `digestLambdaHandler` and returning its response.
- Ensure graceful shutdown on SIGINT or SIGTERM.

## Success Criteria & Verification
- When running `node src/lib/main.js --serve`, Express server starts and listens on configured port.
- GET `/health` returns HTTP 200 and `{"status":"ok"}`.
- POST `/digest` with a valid JSON payload returns HTTP 200 and a JSON body containing `batchItemFailures` and `handler` fields.
- Invalid JSON bodies return HTTP 400 with an error message.
- Integration tests cover both endpoints using Supertest.

## User Scenarios
- Developer runs `npm run start -- --serve` to start the service and uses `curl http://localhost:3000/health` to verify availability.
- CI pipeline stage can use the API to submit a test digest and verify successful forwarding to the handler.

## Testing & Delivery
- Add new unit tests in `tests/unit/http-api.test.js` using Supertest to cover `/health` and `/digest` endpoints.
- Update sandbox README to document `--serve` usage, API endpoints, and environment variable configuration.
- Ensure existing tests and coverage remain green.

Generated issue 1640 for feature "http-api" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1640

title:

Implement HTTP API server with /health and /digest endpoints

And description:

## Summary\nAdd an HTTP API layer into the core CLI tool so that clients can push digest events and perform health checks without relying on SQS or AWS. This change will introduce a new `--serve` flag to spin up an Express server in the same process, mount `/health` and `/digest` endpoints, and cleanly handle shutdowns.\n\n## Changes Required\n1. **src/lib/main.js**\n   - Import and configure Express and `body-parser` (built‚Äêin JSON parser).\n   - Implement a `processServe(args)` function that:  \n     - Detects `--serve` in the CLI arguments.  \n     - Instantiates an Express app:  \n       - GET `/health` returns `200` and JSON body `{ "status": "ok" }`.  \n       - POST `/digest` expects a JSON body, forwards it to the existing `digestLambdaHandler`, and returns its response with status `200`.  \n       - Invalid JSON or missing body returns `400` with an error message.  \n     - Reads port from `process.env.HTTP_API_PORT` or defaults to `3000`.  \n     - Starts the server and logs a startup message.  \n     - Hooks `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` for graceful shutdown.\n   - Invoke `processServe(args)` before other CLI commands in `main` and exit after the server starts.\n\n2. **tests/unit/http-api.test.js**\n   - Create a new test suite using Supertest against the in-memory Express app:  \n     - GET `/health` responds with `200` and JSON `{ status: 'ok' }`.  \n     - POST `/digest` with a valid payload returns `200` with the correct shape: `{ batchItemFailures: [], handler: 'src/lib/main.digestLambdaHandler' }`.  \n     - POST `/digest` with invalid JSON returns `400` and an error message.\n\n3. **sandbox/README.md**\n   - Add an **HTTP API Service** section describing:  \n     - How to launch the server: `npm run start -- --serve` or `node src/lib/main.js --serve`.  \n     - Default port and `HTTP_API_PORT` override.  \n     - Example `curl` commands for `/health` and `/digest`.\n\n## Verification Steps\n1. Run `npm test` and ensure the new `http-api.test.js` suite passes alongside existing tests.\n2. Manually start the service:  \n   ```bash\n   HTTP_API_PORT=4000 npm run start -- --serve\n   ```\n3. Validate endpoints with `curl`:  \n   - `curl http://localhost:4000/health` should return `{"status":"ok"}`.  \n   - `curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/digest -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"key":"k","value":"v","lastModified":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"}'` returns a JSON with `batchItemFailures` and `handler` fields.\n\nOnce merged, this issue will satisfy the HTTP_API feature requirements and enable lightweight, local HTTP integrations for digest processing.
