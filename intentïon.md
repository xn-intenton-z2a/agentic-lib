# Mission Statement

**agentic‚Äëlib** Is a JavaScript library which can be used as a drop in JS implementation or wholesale replacement for 
the steps, jobs, and re-usable workflows below in this repository. It is designed to be used in a GitHub Actions 
workflow to enable your repository to operate in an ‚Äúagentic‚Äù manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate
through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be
invoked using GitHub‚Äôs `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.
## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-24T22:30:21.770Z

Maintained feature HTTP_SERVER.

Feature spec:

# HTTP Server

Enable the library to serve HTTP endpoints for health checks and remote invocation of the digest handler, making it easier to integrate with external services or for local development and monitoring.

# API Endpoints

## GET /health

Return a JSON object with a status field indicating whether the server is running. This supports readiness and liveness checks in containerized or cloud environments.

## POST /digest

Accept a JSON payload representing a digest message, invoke the existing digestLambdaHandler with the supplied data, and return the result including any batch item failures. This endpoint enables remote clients to push events through the same handler logic used in AWS environments.

# CLI Flag

Add a --serve flag to the main CLI. When supplied, the application will start an Express server on a port defined by the environment variable HTTP_PORT or default to 3000. All other CLI flags are ignored when --serve is active.

# Configuration

Environment variables:
- HTTP_PORT (optional): TCP port to bind the HTTP server.
- VERBOSE_STATS: When true, include callCount and uptime in metrics responses.

# Tests

Use supertest to verify each endpoint:
- GET /health returns status up and HTTP 200.
- POST /digest with a valid digest returns a JSON containing batchItemFailures array and handler name.
- Server should respect HTTP_PORT env variable and start on that port in tests.

# README Documentation

Update README to document the new HTTP API usage examples, including curl commands for GET /health and POST /digest.

Hello @Antony-at-Polycode üëã

I‚Äôm seeding the repository now with the mission: **Create a console based i-am-thinking-of-a-number game.**

You can review the scaffolding under `sandbox/features/GUESS_NUMBER_GAME.md` for the number-guessing game spec and observe how the workflows complete the path from mission ‚Üí feature ‚Üí issue ‚Üí code change ‚Üí merge. Let me know if you‚Äôd like to refine the mission statement or suggest next steps!

with the detail:
