Maintained feature CHAT_COMPLETION.

Feature spec:

# Objective
Add a new CLI flag `--chat` that submits a user prompt to the OpenAI Chat Completion API and returns the model-generated response in JSON format.

# Value Proposition
Enable library users to interact with the OpenAI API directly from the CLI, powering quick prompt experimentation and integration into automated scripts without writing custom code.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- Introduce a processChat(args) function in src/lib/main.js that:
  - Detects the presence of the `--chat` flag followed by a prompt string.
  - Initializes OpenAI API client using existing OPENAI_API_KEY config.
  - Sends the prompt to createChatCompletion and awaits the response.
  - Outputs a JSON object to stdout with shape { response: <message content> }.
- Update the main(args) flow to invoke processChat before existing flags and exit if handled.
- Ensure error handling logs using logError and exits with non-zero code on failure.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- Use the existing openai dependency; add no new libraries.
- Respect existing config parsing and do not alter other CLI flags.
- Stay compatible with Node 20 and ESM standards.
- Maintain test isolation; mocks for OpenAI client should work as before.

# User Scenarios & Examples
1. Basic usage:
   - Run: node src/lib/main.js --chat 'Summarize the last 10 GitHub issues'
   - Expect: { response: 'Here is a summary of the last 10 issues...' }
2. Automated script:
   - Command: node src/lib/main.js --chat 'Translate this text to French'
   - Capture output programmatically as JSON for downstream processing.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js and sandbox/tests should include:
  - processChat returns true when flag present and prints valid JSON with response field.
  - Error scenario where OpenAI throws, logError is invoked, and process exits non-zero.
- Mock the OpenAI client to simulate a successful and a failed chat completion.
- Update README with CLI usage example for `--chat` flag.

Maintained feature AGENTIC_HANDLER.

Feature spec:

# Objective
Implement an agenticHandler function that provides a simple interface to the OpenAI ChatCompletion API for generating, refining, or summarizing content based on a prompt. The handler should increment global callCount, return structured output, and integrate with existing logging utilities.

# Value Proposition
Expose a programmatic interface for leveraging OpenAI models directly from the library. This empowers clients to perform content generation, refinement, and summarization tasks within automated workflows or CLI contexts without manual API calls.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- Add an export function agenticHandler(prompt: string, options?: {model?: string, temperature?: number}) returning a Promise of parsed JSON response from the OpenAI API.
- Ensure each invocation increments globalThis.callCount.
- Integrate logInfo to record start and completion events with prompt and response metadata.
- Validate the prompt argument using zod to ensure it is a non-empty string.
- Default model to text-davinci-003 and temperature to 0.7 if not provided.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- Use the existing openai dependency; import Configuration and OpenAIApi.
- Do not add new external dependencies beyond supertest for testing.
- Ensure compatibility with Node 20 and ESM.

# User Scenarios & Examples
1. Programmatic call from another module:

   ```js
   import { agenticHandler } from "@xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib";
   const result = await agenticHandler("Summarize these release notes:", { temperature: 0.5 });
   console.log(result);
   ```

2. CLI integration (future): can be wired to a --agentic flag to accept user prompts.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Create unit tests in tests/unit/agenticHandler.test.js mocking openai.createChatCompletion to return a dummy response and verify output parsing.
- Test that callCount increments after each call.
- Test error handling when API throws an error: agenticHandler should logError and rethrow.
- Ensure zod validation rejects empty prompts with a descriptive error.
