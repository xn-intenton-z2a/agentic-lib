Maintained feature FETCH_OSM with

Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Implement a new CLI flag --fetch-osm <boundingBox> in src/lib/main.js that queries OpenStreetMap data from the Overpass API and emits the response as JSON. This enables the library to crawl geographic data as a public data source and ingest structured geographic features for building the knowledge graph.

# Value Proposition
By integrating direct access to OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API, users can bootstrap geographic nodes, ways, and relations in the knowledge graph without manual data entry or external tooling. This feature leverages built-in Node 20 fetch support and avoids new heavy dependencies.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- Introduce processFetchOsm(args) in src/lib/main.js before the existing help, version, digest, and fetch-wikipedia handlers.
- Recognize --fetch-osm flag followed by a boundingBox string in the format minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat.
- Construct an Overpass QL query to select all nodes, ways, and relations within the specified bounds.
- Perform a POST request to https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter with the query in the request body.
- Parse the JSON response and output it via console.log(JSON.stringify(responseData)).
- On HTTP errors, missing or invalid boundingBox argument, call logError and exit gracefully.
- Ensure environment variables and global callCount handling remain unchanged.

# User Scenarios & Examples
1. node src/lib/main.js --fetch-osm -0.128051,51.507351,-0.127000,51.508000 prints the GeoJSON of OpenStreetMap features in central London.
2. node src/lib/main.js --fetch-osm prints usage guidance and an error about missing bounding box argument.
3. node src/lib/main.js --fetch-osm invalid,bbox logs an error about invalid bounding box format.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Add unit tests in tests/unit/fetchOsm.test.js mocking global fetch for success and failure cases.
- Verify the correct Overpass API URL, POST method, headers and request body are used, and that successful JSON is logged.
- Confirm that error cases invoke logError with descriptive messages for HTTP failures, missing flags, or invalid formats.
- Create sandbox tests in sandbox/tests to cover CLI invocation of --fetch-osm with valid and invalid inputs.
- Update sandbox/README.md to include the new flag, usage examples, and links to MISSION.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Perform manual test by running npm run sandbox -- --fetch-osm -0.1,51.5,0.1,51.6 and verifying the printed GeoJSON format.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- Relies on global fetch available in Node 20.
- No new external dependencies beyond those already in package.json.

Maintained feature FETCH_WIKIDATA with

Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Implement a new CLI flag `--fetch-wikidata <entityId>` in src/lib/main.js that retrieves the JSON representation of a given Wikidata entity from the Wikidata API and emits the response as JSON. This enables the library to crawl structured knowledge from Wikidata as a public data source and ingest it into the physical world knowledge graph.

# Value Proposition
By integrating direct access to Wikidata entities, users can incorporate highly structured and interlinked data points into the knowledge graph, enriching nodes with authoritative identifiers, labels, and multilingual descriptions without manual lookup.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- Introduce `processFetchWikidata(args)` in src/lib/main.js before existing flag handlers.
- Recognize `--fetch-wikidata` followed by a valid entity identifier (e.g., Q42).
- Construct a GET request to `https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/<entityId>.json`.
- On success, parse the JSON response and output it via `console.log(JSON.stringify(responseData))`.
- Handle HTTP errors, missing or malformed entityId argument by calling `logError` with a descriptive message and exiting gracefully.
- Maintain existing environment variable handling, global callCount, and logging conventions.

# User Scenarios & Examples
1. `node src/lib/main.js --fetch-wikidata Q42` prints the JSON data for the Douglas Adams entity.
2. Missing argument: `node src/lib/main.js --fetch-wikidata` logs usage guidance and an error about missing entityId.
3. Invalid ID: `node src/lib/main.js --fetch-wikidata ABC123` logs an error about invalid entity identifier format.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Add unit tests in `tests/unit/fetchWikidata.test.js` mocking global fetch for success and failure cases.
- Verify the correct request URL is used and that successful JSON is fully logged.
- Confirm error cases invoke `logError` with appropriate messages for HTTP failures and argument validation.
- Update `sandbox/README.md` to include the new flag, usage examples, and links to MISSION.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Perform a manual test: `npm run sandbox -- --fetch-wikidata Q64` and verify printed JSON structure.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- Relies on built-in `fetch` in Node 20; no new external dependencies.
- Adheres to existing linting, formatting, and test frameworks (ESM, vitest).
