Maintained feature HELLO_COMMAND with

Feature spec:

# Hello Command
## Objective & Scope
Implement a new --hello flag in the CLI entrypoint at sandbox/source/main.js. When invoked with --hello, the CLI should immediately print Hello World! and exit without processing other commands.

## Value Proposition
Provides a direct way to fulfil the mission statement, confirming the tool is installed and operational. Establishes a pattern for future commands by showing how flags are parsed and executed.

## Success Criteria & Requirements
- Recognize --hello in the argument list before any other flag.
- Output the exact string Hello World! to standard output.
- Terminate execution successfully (exit code 0) after printing.
- No impact on existing --help, --version, and --digest flags when --hello is not provided.

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Only modify sandbox/source/main.js, sandbox/tests/main.test.js, sandbox/README.md and package.json scripts if needed.
- No additional dependencies required.

## User Scenarios & Examples
- Command: npm run sandbox -- --hello
  Expected: Hello World!
- Command: node sandbox/source/main.js --hello
  Expected: Hello World!

## Verification & Acceptance
- Add one or more tests in sandbox/tests/main.test.js to assert Hello World! is printed when --hello is provided.
- Run npm test to confirm tests pass and no regressions occur.

Generated issue 1659 for feature "hello-command" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1659

title:

Implement --hello flag in sandbox CLI for Hello World output

And description:

## Overview

Introduce a new `--hello` flag in the sandbox CLI (`sandbox/source/main.js`) that outputs `Hello World!` and exits immediately, fulfilling the HELLO_COMMAND feature spec.

## Changes to Apply

1. **Update sandbox/source/main.js**
   - At the top of the `main(args)` function, add a conditional to check for `--hello`. If present:
     - Call `console.log("Hello World!")`.
     - Return immediately (so no further logging or commands run).
   - Ensure the behavior of existing flags (`--help`, `--version`, `--digest`) remains unchanged when `--hello` is absent.

2. **Add tests in sandbox/tests/main.test.js**
   - Import `vi` from `vitest` alongside existing imports.
   - Create a new test case:
     - Mock/spying on `console.log`.
     - Invoke `main(["--hello"])`.
     - Assert that `console.log` was called exactly once with the string `Hello World!`.
     - Assert that no other messages (e.g., `Run with: â€¦`) are logged.

3. **Update sandbox/README.md**
   - Add a new section under CLI Usage for the `--hello` flag.
   - Document example invocations:
     ```bash
     npm run sandbox -- --hello
     # Output: Hello World!

     node sandbox/source/main.js --hello
     # Output: Hello World!
     ```

## Verification

1. Run `npm test` and ensure all tests (including the new `--hello` spec) pass.
2. Execute the sandbox script manually:
   ```bash
   npm run sandbox -- --hello
   # Should print exactly: Hello World!
   ```
3. Run without `--hello` to confirm existing behavior is unchanged:
   ```bash
   npm run sandbox
   # Should print: Run with: []
   ```
