Feature spec:

# Bulk Crawl

## Objective
Extend the existing crawl functionality by adding a new CLI flag --crawl-file <FILE> that reads a list of URLs from a local file and crawls each endpoint, normalizing and outputting graph nodes.

## Value Proposition
Allow users to ingest and preview structured data from multiple public APIs in a single command, accelerating batch knowledge graph construction without writing custom scripts.

## Success Criteria & Requirements
- Recognize a new CLI flag --crawl-file followed by a file path.
- Read the file using the Node fs promises API, treating each nonempty line as a URL and ignoring lines starting with a hash.
- For each URL, perform an HTTP GET request with up to 3 retry attempts and exponential backoff on network errors.
- Validate that each response is valid JSON, normalize keys to lowercase and trim whitespace, then include a sourceUrl property on each output node.
- Output each node to stdout as a JSON string prefixed by the originating URL.
- If any URL fetch fails after retries or produces invalid JSON, log an error to stderr and exit with a nonzero code.

## Testability & Stability
- Write unit tests mocking fs read operations and fetch to cover: valid file with multiple URLs, missing file or permission error, invalid JSON payload, mixed success and failure across URLs.
- Ensure clear error messages and correct exit codes.

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Use built-in fs/promises for file reading.
- Continue using node-fetch for HTTP requests.
- Maintain compatibility with ESM and Node 20+.

## User Scenario
CLI Usage example:
  --crawl-file urls.txt
where urls.txt contains:
  # List of public endpoints
  https://api.example.com/data1.json
  https://api.example.com/data2.json

Expected output streams normalized node JSON for each URL.

Generated issue 1632 for feature "crawl-public-data" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1632

title:

Implement --crawl CLI command to fetch and normalize public JSON data

And description:

We need to extend the sandbox CLI with a new `--crawl <URL>` command that will fetch JSON from a public endpoint, normalize it into graph nodes, and output each node as a JSON string on stdout. This issue focuses on core functionality for data ingestion without manual scripting.

**1. Update Dependencies (package.json)**
- Add `node-fetch@^3.0.0` as a dependency.

**2. Implement CLI Flag (sandbox/source/main.js)**
- Import `fetch` from `node-fetch`.
- In the `main(args)` function (or CLI dispatch logic), detect `--crawl` followed by a URL argument.
- On match, perform an HTTP GET to the URL with up to 3 retry attempts and exponential backoff (e.g., 100ms, 200ms, 400ms) on network errors.
- Check the HTTP status code: on non-2xx, print an error via `logError`, exit with code `1`.
- Attempt to parse the response body as JSON; on parse error, log the error, exit code `1`.
- Normalize each top-level object in the JSON array (or single object) by:
  - Converting all keys to lowercase.
  - Trimming whitespace from string values.
- Output each normalized node to `stdout` as a JSON string on its own line.

**3. Add Unit Tests (sandbox/tests/crawl.test.js)**
- Mock `fetch` to simulate:
  1. Successful JSON response (array of objects) and verify correct normalization and stdout output.
  2. HTTP error status (e.g., 404) and verify exit code `1` and error message.
  3. Invalid JSON payload and verify exit code `1` and clear error message.
- Test that retry logic is invoked on transient network errors by mocking `fetch` to fail twice before succeeding.

**4. Update Documentation and README**
- In `sandbox/README.md`, add a new section under "Usage" for `--crawl`:
  ```bash
  node sandbox/source/main.js --crawl <URL>
  ```
  - Describe expected output format and error conditions.
- Optionally, add a markdown doc in `sandbox/docs/` (e.g., `crawl_public_data.md`) summarizing the feature, or reference the existing spec in `sandbox/features/CRAWL_PUBLIC_DATA.md`.

**Verification**
- Run `npm install` then `npm test` to ensure new tests pass.
- Manually run:
  ```bash
  node sandbox/source/main.js --crawl https://api.example.com/data.json
  ```
  and confirm normalized JSON nodes on stdout.

This covers the core implementation of `--crawl` for fetching and outputting public JSON data in graph node format.

LLM API Usage:
```json
{"prompt_tokens":7083,"completion_tokens":1296,"total_tokens":8379,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":640,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
```

Maintained feature PARALLEL_CRAWL with

Feature spec:

# Parallel Crawl

## Objective
Add a new optional CLI flag `--concurrency <N>` to control the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP requests when performing a bulk crawl via the `--crawl-file` command.

## Value Proposition
By parallelizing fetch operations with a configurable concurrency limit, users can significantly speed up large-scale data ingestion while balancing resource usage and avoiding rate limits on external APIs.

## Success Criteria & Requirements
- Recognize an optional `--concurrency` flag followed by a positive integer value.
- Default to a concurrency level of 5 when the flag is not provided.
- Integrate with existing `--crawl-file` functionality to ensure that no more than N fetch requests run in parallel.
- Maintain existing retry logic (up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff) and error handling for each URL.
- Validate that concurrency is a positive integer; exit with a clear error message on invalid input.

## Testability & Stability
- Write unit tests mocking `node-fetch` and `fs/promises` to simulate different URL lists and delays.
- Verify that the pool of active requests never exceeds the configured concurrency.
- Test default concurrency behavior and custom values (e.g., 1, 10).
- Test invalid values (zero, negative, non-integer) to ensure proper validation and error messages.

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Implement a simple promise pool internally without adding new external dependencies.
- Continue using `node-fetch` for HTTP requests and `fs/promises` for file operations.
- Ensure compatibility with ESM and Node.js 20+ environments.

## User Scenario & Examples
CLI usage:
  --crawl-file urls.txt --concurrency 10
Where `urls.txt` contains a list of endpoints. Users observe up to 10 simultaneous fetches with normalized JSON nodes streamed to stdout.

## Verification & Acceptance
- Unit tests demonstrate correct concurrency enforcement and default behavior.
- Manual tests with large URL lists confirm improved throughput and stable resource usage.
