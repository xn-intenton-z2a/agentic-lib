## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-25T02:33:05.446Z

Maintained feature HEALTH_CHECK_SERVER.

Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Provide a built-in HTTP server that exposes health and runtime metrics for monitoring and integration with observability systems. This complements the existing CLI and Lambda functionality by offering a lightweight Express endpoint to verify service health and retrieve runtime statistics.

# Value Proposition
- Enables external systems to perform health checks (e.g., Kubernetes, load balancers).  
- Allows retrieval of call count and uptime metrics at runtime.  
- Improves transparency and monitoring of agentic-lib in production environments.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- Add a new CLI flag `--serve` in `src/lib/main.js` to start the health server.  
- Use Express (already in dependencies) to launch an HTTP server on a configurable port (default 3000).  
- Implement two routes:  
  - `/health` returns HTTP 200 with JSON `{ status: "ok" }`.  
  - `/metrics` returns HTTP 200 with JSON `{ callCount, uptime }`.  
- Ensure graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
- Add necessary tests using supertest in `tests/unit` to verify endpoints and shutdown behavior.
- Document usage examples and CLI invocation in `sandbox/README.md`.

# Test Scenarios & Examples
- Starting the server with `node src/lib/main.js --serve --port 4000` and requesting `GET /health` returns `{ status: "ok" }`.  
- Requesting `GET /metrics` returns current `callCount` and `uptime` in seconds.  
- Verify server stops cleanly on process termination signals.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Automated tests in `tests/unit/health-server.test.js` pass coverage for both endpoints and shutdown.  
- Manual tests confirm endpoints respond correctly and port configuration is honored.  
- README updated with usage examples and instructions.

## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-25T02:33:46.797Z

Maintained feature CHAT_CLI.

Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Provide a new CLI subcommand that allows users to send arbitrary text prompts to the OpenAI API and receive structured responses. This extends the existing CLI functionality, leveraging the configured API key to perform chat completions directly from the terminal.

# Value Proposition
- Empowers developers to prototype conversational interactions or test prompt ideas without leaving the terminal.
- Demonstrates core OpenAI integration in agentic-lib, showcasing the agentic coding system in action.
- Complements the `--digest` and `--version` commands by introducing a true AI capability that can be scripted or used in CI workflows.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- Add a new CLI flag `--chat <prompt>` in `src/lib/main.js`.
- Use the `openai` package and the existing `OPENAI_API_KEY` configuration to construct a `Configuration` and `OpenAIApi` client.
- Invoke `createChatCompletion` with a minimal chat model (gpt-3.5-turbo) and the supplied user prompt.
- Parse the API response and output the assistant's message content to stdout in JSON form.
- Handle and log errors using `logError`, returning an exit code of `1` on failure.
- Increase `globalThis.callCount` by one for each invocation and include stats when `VERBOSE_STATS` is enabled.
- Write unit tests in `tests/unit/chat-cli.test.js` using `vi.mock` to simulate the OpenAI API, verifying success and error scenarios.
- Document usage examples in `sandbox/README.md`, showing how to invoke the chat command and interpret the output.

# Test Scenarios & Examples
- Running `node src/lib/main.js --chat "Hello, AI!"` prints a JSON string with the API response message content.
- Simulating an API error causes a logged error entry and process exit code `1`.
- When `VERBOSE_STATS` is true, the output includes callCount and uptime JSON following the response.

# Verification & Acceptance
- New tests in `tests/unit/chat-cli.test.js` pass and cover success and error flows.
- Manual testing confirms the CLI flag is recognized, calls the OpenAI API, and prints the correct JSON output.
- README examples accurately reflect usage and exit codes.
