Maintained feature JSONLD_CRAWLER with

Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Add a new CLI command `--extract-jsonld <URL>` to fetch an arbitrary web page, parse HTML content for JSON-LD script blocks, and ingest the extracted structured data into the existing knowledge graph pipeline.

# Value Proposition
Enable automatic discovery and ingestion of semantic markup embedded in public web pages. Users can point the CLI at any URL containing JSON-LD to accelerate population of the knowledge graph without manual data extraction.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- The CLI accepts `--extract-jsonld` followed by a valid URL.
- On invocation, fetch the page HTML using native `fetch`.
- Parse the HTML and locate all `<script type="application/ld+json">` elements.
- Deserialize each JSON-LD block into an object and wrap each in a digest `{ source: URL, data: <jsonLdObject> }`.
- Pass each digest through `createSQSEventFromDigest` and invoke `digestLambdaHandler` sequentially.
- Log the number of JSON-LD blocks found and summary of each ingestion.
- On network or parse errors, log an error message with details and exit with code 1.
- Return exit code 0 when at least one block is successfully ingested.

# Dependencies & Constraints
- Introduce `cheerio` as a new dependency for HTML parsing.
- Use native Node 20+ `fetch` API for network requests.
- No changes outside of `src/lib/main.js`, test files, `README.md`, and `package.json`.
- Tests should mock fetch and cheerio parsing to simulate various page structures.

# User Scenarios & Examples
1. Successful Extraction:
   - Command: `node src/lib/main.js --extract-jsonld https://example.com/page-with-jsonld`
   - Logs include count of extracted blocks and confirmation of each digest ingested.

2. No JSON-LD Present:
   - Command: `node src/lib/main.js --extract-jsonld https://example.com/plain-page`
   - Logs a warning indicating zero JSON-LD scripts found and exits with code 0 without pipeline errors.

3. Invalid HTML or Network Failure:
   - Logs an error describing the failure and exits with code 1.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Unit tests covering:
  - HTML with one JSON-LD block ingested successfully.
  - HTML with multiple JSON-LD blocks ingested sequentially.
  - HTML without JSON-LD produces a warning and graceful exit.
  - Network failure or invalid HTML triggers error logging and exit code 1.
- Manual test using a local HTTP server serving example HTML pages.

# Implementation Notes
- In `src/lib/main.js`, implement `processExtractJsonLd(args)` before existing command handlers.
- Register `--extract-jsonld` in the main CLI dispatch sequence.
- Update `package.json` to add `cheerio` dependency.
- Extend `README.md` to document usage of the new flag and provide examples.

Generated issue 1628 for feature "data-crawler" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1628

title:

Add `--crawl` CLI command for Data Crawler ingestion into knowledge graph

And description:

We need to implement the Data Crawler feature by adding a new `--crawl <URL>` option to our CLI in `src/lib/main.js`. This will allow users to fetch JSON from any public HTTP endpoint and feed the payload into our existing digest processing pipeline (via `createSQSEventFromDigest` and `digestLambdaHandler`).

Specifically, please update the following files in a single LLM invocation:

1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - In the `generateUsage` function, append a line for `--crawl <URL>`.
   - Implement an async helper `processCrawl(args)`:
     - Detect the `--crawl` flag and its URL argument.
     - Log an info entry before fetching: `Fetching URL: <URL>`.
     - Use the native Node.js `fetch` API to perform an HTTP GET.
     - On a successful response:
       - Read the response text and parse JSON (throw and catch parse errors).
       - Log an info entry including `url`, `status`, and `size` (byte length of raw text).
       - Wrap the parsed JSON into a digest object `{ source: URL, data: <parsed JSON> }`.
       - Invoke `createSQSEventFromDigest(digest)`, then `await digestLambdaHandler(...)`.
       - Print a confirmation message: `Crawl completed for <URL>` and `process.exit(0)`.
     - On network errors or invalid JSON:
       - Log an error with details and call `process.exit(1)`.
     - Return `true` when `--crawl` is handled, `false` otherwise.
   - Invoke `await processCrawl(args)` in `main()` before falling back to the no-command logic.

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Add tests for `--crawl`:
     - **Success scenario**: stub `global.fetch` to return a mock JSON payload and a 200 status. Spy on `createSQSEventFromDigest` and `digestLambdaHandler` to confirm they receive the correct digest. Use `vi.spyOn` or `vi.stubGlobal` as needed. Ensure `process.exit(0)` is called and the confirmation message is printed.
     - **Fetch error**: stub `fetch` to throw an exception. Confirm that an error is logged and `process.exit(1)` is called.
     - **Invalid JSON**: stub `fetch` to return non-JSON text (e.g., `"not json"`), confirm exit code 1 and appropriate error log.
   - Mock `process.exit` to throw so tests can catch exit codes.

3. **sandbox/README.md**
   - Document the new `--crawl <URL>` flag under the CLI usage section, including an example invocation and expected output.

4. **package.json** (if needed)
   - No new dependencies required since Node 20+ has global `fetch`.

Verification:
- Run `npm test` to ensure all unit tests pass.
- Manually run `node src/lib/main.js --crawl http://localhost:3000/data` against a local JSON server to verify logs, confirmation message, and exit code.
