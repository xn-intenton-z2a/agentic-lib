Hello @Antony-at-Polycode ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m seeding the repository now with the mission: **Create a console based i-am-thinking-of-a-number game.**

You can review the newly added scaffolding under `sandbox/features/GUESS_NUMBER_GAME.md`, implement the initial game loop in `sandbox/source/main.js`, and check the placeholder tests in `sandbox/tests/guess-number.test.js`. Next, Iâ€™ll start coding the core guessing logic and write first TTY integration tests. Let me know if youâ€™d like any adjustments or next steps! ðŸš€

with the detail:

"Create a console based i-am-thinking-of-a-number game."
