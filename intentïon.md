# Mission Statement

**agentic‑lib** Is a JavaScript library which can be used as a drop in JS implementation or wholesale replacement for 
the steps, jobs, and re-usable workflows below in this repository. It is designed to be used in a GitHub Actions 
workflow to enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate
through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be
invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.
## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-23T00:54:57.160Z

Maintained feature HTTP_SERVER.

Feature spec:

# HTTP Server Mode

## Overview

Add an HTTP server layer using Express to enable remote invocation of key library operations through REST endpoints. This feature allows users to start a lightweight web service that exposes existing functionality such as digest processing and version reporting, making it easier to integrate with external systems and webhooks.

## Scope & Purpose

- Introduce a new CLI flag `--serve` to launch the HTTP server.
- Support GET `/version` endpoint returning version and timestamp.
- Support POST `/digest` endpoint accepting a JSON payload and invoking the existing `digestLambdaHandler`, returning batch item failures.
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI flags.

## Success Criteria & Requirements

- HTTP server listens on port defined by `PORT` environment variable or defaults to `3000`.
- GET `/version` returns JSON with `version` (from package.json) and `timestamp`.
- POST `/digest` accepts a JSON body, invokes `digestLambdaHandler`, and returns JSON with `batchItemFailures` and handler name.
- Error responses return appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON error message.
- Server logs requests and errors using existing `logInfo` and `logError` utilities.
- Tests cover each endpoint using Supertest.

## Implementation Details

1. Add Express dependency (already present) to the main source file.
2. In main execution flow, detect `--serve` flag and start Express app instead of CLI output.
3. Mount routes:
   - `app.get('/version', async (req, res) => { ... });`
   - `app.post('/digest', async (req, res) => { ... });`
4. Use built-in JSON body parsing middleware.
5. Log incoming requests details and outgoing responses.

## Testing & Verification

- Create new Supertest-based tests under `tests/unit/`:
  - Verify `GET /version` returns correct shape and status 200.
  - Verify `POST /digest` with valid payload returns batch item failures array.
  - Simulate invalid JSON or missing body to confirm error status and message.
- Ensure CLI `--serve` flag triggers server startup without errors in local testing.

## Documentation Updates

- Update README to include HTTP Server Mode section:
  - Usage examples for `npm run start:http` and direct `node src/lib/main.js --serve`.
  - API reference for `/version` and `/digest` endpoints.

Enhanced issue https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1595 with action enhance and updated description:

Title: Resolve lint errors and fix parsing error in src/lib/main.js

Description:
The import statement in `src/lib/main.js` contains a syntax typo (`imp bug ort`) that causes a parsing error, and there are two lint warnings in `sandbox/source/main.js` that should be addressed to maintain code quality and consistency.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Correct the import statement in `src/lib/main.js` (line 9) from `imp bug ort { fileURLToPath } from "url";` to `import { fileURLToPath } from "url";` so the module can be loaded without syntax errors.
2. In `sandbox/source/main.js`, replace `.then()/catch()` chains in `processVersion` and `processDigest` functions with `async`/`await` syntax to satisfy the `promise/prefer-await-to-then` lint rule.
3. Replace any use of `Math.random()` in fallback record identifier generation with a secure UUID generator (e.g., `crypto.randomUUID()`) or explicitly disable the `sonarjs/pseudo-random` rule with a comment and justifiable rationale.
4. Verify that running the following commands produce no errors or relevant warnings:
   - `npm test` (all tests pass)
   - `npm run linting-fix "." -- --max-warnings=0` (no errors or warnings in these files)
   - `npm run start` and `npm run start:http` (application starts successfully without errors)
5. Add or update unit tests as needed to confirm:
   - The corrected import allows successful dynamic import of `src/lib/main.js` in tests.
   - Fallback record identifiers are valid UUID strings if using `crypto.randomUUID()`.

Documentation:
No changes to external documentation are required for these internal fixes.

LLM API Usage:

```json
{"prompt_tokens":8897,"completion_tokens":1337,"total_tokens":10234,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":896,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
```

Hello @Antony-at-Polycode 👋

Thanks for checking in! I’m continuing to track our progress closely against the mission. Sharing the full discussion history actually helps me maintain context and keep our actions on track.

However, if you’d prefer to focus on just the most recent threads or limit the context to avoid complexity, I can adapt. Let me know your preference:

1. Continue including all past discussions for full context.
2. Limit to the last N threads or a specific time window.
3. Only share threads relevant to the current feature under development.

I’ll follow whichever approach you choose. 🙂
