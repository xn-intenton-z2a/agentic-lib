Maintained feature FETCH_PUBLIC_DATA with

Feature spec:

# Objective & Scope
Enable the CLI to fetch and print JSON data from a configurable public API endpoint, providing a foundational data ingestion step for building the knowledge graph of the physical world.

# Value Proposition
This feature empowers users to retrieve structured data from any HTTP JSON API directly via the sandbox CLI. It establishes a simple, reusable entry point for seeding the knowledge graph with real-world datasets, accelerating prototyping and integration of diverse data sources.

# Success Criteria & Requirements

- The CLI recognizes a new flag `--fetch <URL>` and performs an HTTP GET request to the specified endpoint.
- Response bodies are printed as formatted JSON to stdout.
- Errors during fetch must be caught and logged as structured error entries via `logError`.
- No external dependencies beyond Node.js built-in fetch; ensure compatibility with Node 20+.

# Dependencies & Constraints

- Relies on the built-in global `fetch` API available in Node.js 20 or later.
- Must not introduce new npm dependencies.
- Side effects limited to `sandbox/source/main.js` and corresponding test and README files.

# User Scenarios & Examples

1. Fetching real-time earthquake data from USGS:
   sandbox/source/main.js --fetch https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_hour.geojson

2. Pulling weather information:
   sandbox/source/main.js --fetch https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MPX/107,69/observations

# Verification & Acceptance

- Add tests in `sandbox/tests/main.test.js` mocking `fetch` to return a dummy JSON payload and assert that CLI prints it exactly.
- Verify that providing an invalid URL triggers `logError` and exits gracefully.
- Update `sandbox/README.md` with usage examples and link to MISSION.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
- `npm test` must pass all existing and new test cases.

Generated issue 1619 for feature "data-crawler" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1619

title:

Implement DATA_CRAWLER CLI to fetch and output JSON from a URL

And description:

We need to add basic data crawling functionality to the sandbox CLI so that we can fetch public data sources and begin building our knowledge graph. This issue will implement a `--crawl <url>` flag in `sandbox/source/main.js`, add tests in `sandbox/tests/main.test.js`, and update `sandbox/README.md` with usage documentation.

Changes to make:

1. Update `sandbox/source/main.js`:
   - Parse a new `--crawl` flag followed by a URL argument.
   - Use the built-in `fetch` API (Node 20 global fetch) to retrieve data from the provided URL.
   - Attempt to parse the response as JSON and `console.log` the result in stringified form.
   - Handle fetch or parsing errors by printing a JSON-formatted error object via `console.error` and exiting with a non-zero code.

2. Extend `sandbox/tests/main.test.js`:
   - Mock the global `fetch` function to return a dummy JSON payload for a fake URL.
   - Add a test case that calls `main(["--crawl", "https://example.com/data"])` and asserts that `console.log` was called with the expected JSON string.
   - Add a test case for handling a fetch error (e.g., mock `fetch` to reject) and assert that `console.error` is called and that the process exits non-zero (or simulate behavior without actual exit).

3. Update `sandbox/README.md`:
   - Document the new `--crawl` option under the CLI Usage section.
   - Provide an example invocation: `node sandbox/source/main.js --crawl https://api.example.com/data` and sample output.

4. Verification:
   - Run `npm test` and ensure all existing and new tests pass.
   - Run `npm run sandbox -- --crawl https://example.com/data` and verify JSON is printed to stdout.

Only modify the following files:
- `sandbox/source/main.js`
- `sandbox/tests/main.test.js`
- `sandbox/README.md`

This will lay the groundwork for our DATA_CRAWLER feature and enable ingestion of public JSON data sources.

Maintained feature HTTP_ENDPOINT with

Feature spec:

# HTTP Endpoint for Digest Ingestion

# Objective & Scope
Add an HTTP POST endpoint `/digest` powered by Express that accepts JSON payloads and invokes the existing digestLambdaHandler to simulate SQS events.

# Value Proposition
- Enables direct integration with HTTP clients, webhooks, and external services without AWS setup.
- Simplifies local development and testing of the digest workflow.

# Success Criteria & Requirements
- New Express server in sandbox/source/main.js listens on `PORT` environment variable or defaults to 3000.
- Implement `POST /digest` route that parses JSON body, calls `createSQSEventFromDigest`, then `digestLambdaHandler`.
- Route returns a JSON object with `batchItemFailures` and `handler` information.
- Invalid JSON bodies result in a 400 status with an error message logged using `logError`.
- All incoming requests and errors are logged via `logInfo` and `logError`.

# User Scenarios & Examples
- Sending `POST /digest` with valid JSON `{ "key": "events/1.json", "value": "12345" }` returns HTTP 200 with expected response structure.
- Sending malformed JSON triggers HTTP 400 with descriptive error payload.

# Verification & Acceptance
- Add integration tests in `sandbox/tests` using supertest to cover valid and invalid requests.
- Ensure `npm test` passes with new tests and coverage metrics include the HTTP endpoint.

Generated issue 1620 for feature "fetch-public-data" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/1620

title:

Implement FETCH_PUBLIC_DATA CLI flag in sandbox to fetch and output JSON

And description:

### Objective

Enable the sandbox CLI (`sandbox/source/main.js`) to fetch and print JSON data from a public API endpoint using a new `--fetch <URL>` flag. This is the foundational ingestion step for seeding the knowledge graph of the physical world.

### Scope of Work

1. **Modify `sandbox/source/main.js`**
   - Change `main` to an `async` function.
   - Parse `--fetch <URL>` in the argument list:
     - If `--fetch` is present, extract the next value as `url`.
     - Use the built-in global `fetch(url)` to perform an HTTP GET.
     - On success (`response.ok`), parse the JSON body and `console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2))` to stdout.
     - On HTTP error (`!response.ok`), or any thrown error, catch and `console.error(JSON.stringify({ level: "error", message: "Failed to fetch data", error: err.toString() }))`, then exit with non-zero code.
   - If `--fetch` was handled, return early and do not run the default `console.log` behavior.

2. **Extend `sandbox/tests/main.test.js`**
   - Mock `global.fetch` using Vitest:
     - A successful fetch returning `{ hello: "world" }`. Capture `console.log` and assert that it printed the JSON string with 2-space indentation.
     - A failing fetch (either `fetch` throws or returns non-OK). Capture `console.error` and assert it was called with a structured error log.

3. **Update `sandbox/README.md`**
   - Add a **Fetch Public Data** section under CLI Usage:
     ```markdown
     ## Fetch Public Data

     The `--fetch <URL>` flag retrieves JSON data from a public API and prints it formatted to stdout.

     ### Examples
     ```bash
     npm run sandbox -- --fetch https://api.example.com/data.json
     ```
     ```json
     {
       "key": "value",
       "array": [1, 2, 3]
     }
     ```
     ```bash
     npm run sandbox -- --fetch invalid-url
     ```
     Logs a structured error JSON to stderr and exits with code &gt; 0.
     ```
     ```
     Add links to [MISSION.md](./MISSION.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Verification & Acceptance Criteria

- `sandbox/source/main.js` passes existing tests and new fetch tests (`npm test`).
- Running `npm run sandbox -- --fetch <valid JSON URL>` prints pretty JSON to stdout.
- Running with invalid URL prints a structured error log to stderr and exits non-zero.
- README updates render correctly and include examples.
- No new dependencies added; rely on Node.js 20+ built-in `fetch`.

LLM API Usage:
```json
{"prompt_tokens":7684,"completion_tokens":1650,"total_tokens":9334,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":960,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
```

Updated feature development issue https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/issues/ with enhanced description:

Title: Implement DATA_CRAWLER CLI to Fetch and Output JSON

Description:
Add a new `--crawl <url>` flag to the sandbox CLI (`sandbox/source/main.js`) to fetch public JSON data and print it to stdout. This will form the foundation of our DATA_CRAWLER feature for ingesting public data sources into our knowledge graph.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. CLI Behavior:
   - When invoked as `node sandbox/source/main.js --crawl https://example.com/data`:
     a. The global `fetch` API is called exactly once with the specified URL.
     b. If the HTTP response has a valid JSON body, it is parsed and `console.log(JSON.stringify(parsedBody))` is called.
     c. The process completes with exit code `0` (or does not explicitly exit with non-zero).
2. Error Handling:
   a. Network Errors:
      - If `fetch` rejects (e.g., network failure), catch the error and call `console.error(JSON.stringify({ error: 'FetchError', message: error.message, url: <url> }))`.
      - Exit with a non-zero code (e.g., `process.exit(1)`).
   b. JSON Parse Errors:
      - If `response.json()` rejects (invalid JSON), catch the error and call `console.error(JSON.stringify({ error: 'JSONParseError', message: error.message, url: <url> }))`.
      - Exit with a non-zero code.
3. Unit Tests (`sandbox/tests/main.test.js`):
   - Mock the global `fetch`:
     • Test successful fetch scenario: mock `fetch` to resolve with an object whose `json()` returns a dummy payload. Assert that `console.log` was called with the correct JSON string and that the process did not exit with an error.
     • Test fetch rejection: mock `fetch` to reject with an Error. Assert that `console.error` was called with a JSON string containing `error: 'FetchError'` and that `process.exit` was called with a non-zero code.
     • Test invalid JSON: mock `fetch` to resolve but `response.json()` rejects. Assert that `console.error` was called with `error: 'JSONParseError'` and that `process.exit` was called with a non-zero code.
4. Documentation (`sandbox/README.md`):
   - Add a new section under **CLI Usage** for `--crawl <url>`.
   - Provide an example invocation:
     ```bash
     node sandbox/source/main.js --crawl https://api.example.com/data
     # Expected output: { "foo": "bar", "baz": 123 }
     ```
5. Verification:
   - Running `npm test` passes all existing and new tests.
   - Running `npm run sandbox -- --crawl <valid-url>` prints the fetched JSON or logs a JSON-formatted error and sets the correct exit code.

LLM API Usage:
```json
{"prompt_tokens":6697,"completion_tokens":1440,"total_tokens":8137,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":768,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
```
