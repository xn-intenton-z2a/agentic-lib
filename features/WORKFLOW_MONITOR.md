# Workflow Monitor

## Overview
This feature introduces an autonomous monitoring system for the agentic-lib workflows. It continuously tracks the performance, error occurrences, and execution metrics of GitHub Actions workflows powered by the library. The Workflow Monitor leverages the existing logging infrastructure and integrates with LLM delegation where necessary, providing real-time diagnostics and actionable alerts when thresholds are breached.

## Objectives
- **Real-Time Metrics:** Collect and display key performance indicators (KPIs) from ongoing workflow executions such as duration, frequency of errors, and success rates.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Automatically detect and flag unusual activities or errors using predefined thresholds, enabling proactive intervention.
- **Integration with Issue Management:** Seamlessly create GitHub issues via existing ISSUE_CREATOR or ISSUE_BATCHER features when anomalies are detected, ensuring continuous improvement and timely fixes.
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Generate concise reports and summaries of workflow performance, to be optionally published as part of action outputs for further analysis.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Integrate with the current logging functions (e.g., logInfo and logError) in src/lib/main.js to capture execution metrics.
   - Use environment variables and configuration settings to define monitoring thresholds and intervals.

2. **Anomaly Detection Engine:**
   - Implement a lightweight engine that processes collected metrics, compares them against defined thresholds, and identifies anomalies.
   - Support configuration for both immediate alerts and batch reporting.

3. **Issue Integration:**
   - Leverage existing features such as ISSUE_CREATOR and ISSUE_BATCHER to automatically initiate issue creation when anomalies are detected.
   - Provide detailed context in the issue report including log snippets, timestamps, and detected anomalies.

4. **Reporting & Visualization:**
   - Generate summary reports that are outputted to standard logs and optionally returned to consuming GitHub Action workflows via outputs.
   - Support manual triggering for detailed diagnostic reports.

## Verification & Acceptance Criteria
- The Workflow Monitor collects and logs detailed metrics on workflow executions in real-time.
- Anomalies (e.g., high error rates or abnormally long runtimes) are detected based on configurable thresholds.
- On anomaly detection, the system creates detailed issue reports using the ISSUE_CREATOR integration.
- Automated tests are provided covering metric collection, threshold breach scenarios, and successful issue creation.
- The feature seamlessly integrates with the overall mission of supporting autonomous workflows in agentic-lib.
