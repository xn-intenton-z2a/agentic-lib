# CLI_UTILS Feature Specification

This feature consolidates and upgrades the command line interface functionalities of the repository. It merges the previously separate APPLY_FIX and AGENT_CLI features into a unified CLI utility that supports agentic command processing, automated fix application, simulation of errors and delays, diagnostics, status reporting, and version output. 

## Objectives

- Provide a single CLI entry point for processing agentic commands (both single and batch modes).
- Enable automated code, test, README, and dependency fixes via the --apply-fix flag.
- Enhance observability with detailed logging, diagnostics (--diagnostics) and runtime health reports (--status).
- Support additional CLI behaviors such as simulating errors (--simulate-error), delaying execution (--simulate-delay), and dry-run mode (--dry-run).
- Maintain clear and informative usage output (--help) and proper version reporting (--version).

## User Scenarios

**Scenario: Agentic Command Processing**

- When a user invokes the CLI with the --agentic flag and a valid JSON payload with a single command or an array of commands, the system validates and processes the commands sequentially.
- Each valid command is logged with its execution time (executionTimeMS) and the global invocation counter is incremented.

**Scenario: Automated Fix Application**

- When the CLI is invoked with the --apply-fix flag, the system applies pre-defined automated fixes to source, test, README, and dependency files.
- A success message "Applied fix successfully" is logged to indicate completion.

**Scenario: Simulation and Diagnostics**

- When the --simulate-error flag is provided, the system logs a simulated error and exits with a non-zero exit code, aiding in testing error handling.
- When the --simulate-delay flag is used with a specified delay in milliseconds, execution is deferred appropriately to simulate processing latency.
- The --diagnostics flag outputs an in-depth report detailing configuration, Node.js version, environment variables, and other runtime data.

**Scenario: Informational Commands**

- The --version flag outputs current version information along with a timestamp, extracted from package.json.
- The --status flag provides a JSON summary of runtime health including configuration, invocation count, and uptime.
- The --dry-run flag allows a no-side-effect execution mode, confirming action without performing any operations.

## Success Criteria

- Correct merging of functionalities with detailed logging and error handling.
- Comprehensive test coverage ensuring that each CLI flag returns expected outputs.
- Consistent and clear output messages across all CLI commands.
- Full integration with existing workflows without disrupting the Workflow Chain feature.

## Dependencies & Constraints

- This feature is implemented solely by modifying existing source, test, README, and dependency files.
- It adheres to Node 20+ requirements and ECMAScript module standards.
- No new files are added, and legacy features APPLY_FIX and AGENT_CLI are merged into this new unified CLI utility.

## Verification & Acceptance

- Automated tests should cover all CLI flags including edge cases (e.g., invalid JSON, empty commands, commands equivalent to "NaN").
- Manual testing should confirm that the CLI displays usage, version, diagnostics, and proper error messages.
- Code reviews ensure adherence to the contributing guidelines and synchronization with updated documentation in README.md.
