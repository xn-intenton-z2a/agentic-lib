# CLI_UTILS Feature Specification

This feature consolidates and upgrades the command line interface functionalities of the repository. It merges previously separate functionalities into a unified CLI utility that supports agentic command processing, automated fix applications, diagnostics, and detailed runtime reporting. In this update, an additional output mode has been introduced to support JSON formatted output for easier integration with automated scripts and tools.

## Objectives

- Provide a single CLI entry point to process both single and batch agentic commands.
- Enable automated code, test, README, and dependency fixes via the --apply-fix flag.
- Enhance observability with detailed logging, diagnostics (--diagnostics), and runtime health reports (--status).
- Support additional CLI behaviors such as simulating errors (--simulate-error) and delays (--simulate-delay), and dry-run mode (--dry-run).
- Introduce a new JSON output mode (--json) that forces output in structured JSON for commands like --help, --diagnostics, and --status. This allows integration with automation tools without the need for additional parsing.
- Maintain clear usage output (--help) and proper version reporting (--version).

## User Scenarios

**Scenario: Agentic Command Processing**
- When a user invokes the CLI with the --agentic flag and a valid JSON payload (either a single command or an array of commands), the system validates the input and processes each command sequentially.
- Each valid command is logged with its execution time (executionTimeMS) and the global invocation counter is incremented.

**Scenario: Automated Fix Application**
- Invoking the CLI with --apply-fix applies pre-defined automated fixes to source, test, README, and dependency files, with a success message logged.

**Scenario: Simulation, Diagnostics and JSON Mode**
- The --simulate-error flag tests error handling by logging a simulated error and then exiting with a non-zero status.
- The --simulate-delay flag delays execution by the specified number of milliseconds.
- The --diagnostics and --status flags output detailed runtime and configuration information. When the optional --json flag is provided alongside these commands, the output is strictly formatted as a JSON object, making it easy for external systems to parse the response.

**Scenario: Informational Commands**
- The --version flag outputs version information from package.json with a timestamp in JSON format.
- The --help command displays detailed usage instructions, including the new JSON output option, ensuring users understand all available commands.
- The --cli-utils flag displays a comprehensive summary of all available CLI commands with brief descriptions.

## Success Criteria

- Correct and consistent merging of CLI functionalities with detailed logging and error handling across all commands.
- Implementation of the new JSON output mode that modifies the output formatting for critical commands (--help, --diagnostics, --status) when --json is used.
- Comprehensive test coverage ensuring that each CLI flag returns the expected outputs, including the new JSON mode.
- Full integration with existing workflows without disrupting the Workflow Chain feature.

## Dependencies & Constraints

- This feature is implemented solely by modifying existing source, test, README, and dependency files.
- It adheres to Node 20+ and ECMAScript module standards.
- No new files are added, and legacy features remain intact while incorporating the JSON output enhancement.

## Verification & Acceptance

- Automated tests must cover all CLI flags, including edge cases (e.g., invalid JSON, empty commands, commands equating to "NaN"), and validate that the JSON mode accurately formats output.
- Manual testing should confirm that when --json is provided with informational flags, the output is a clear, valid JSON object.
- Code reviews will ensure that the refactored CLI utility meets the contributing guidelines and that documentation in README.md is updated accordingly.

By introducing the JSON output mode, this update enhances the utilityâ€™s automation readiness and user-friendliness, aligning with the mission of enabling intuitive, agentic operations through a flexible command line interface.
