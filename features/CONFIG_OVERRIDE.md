# CONFIG_OVERRIDE Feature Specification

This feature introduces the ability to override configuration settings at runtime using a new CLI flag `--config-override`. This flag accepts a JSON string which will be parsed and merged with the existing configuration loaded from environment variables and the `.env` file. This makes it easier for users to test different configuration scenarios without modifying external configuration files or environment variables.

## Objectives

- Provide a mechanism to dynamically override configuration properties (such as `GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`) at runtime.
- Allow developers and users to experiment with different configurations in a transient manner using a simple CLI flag.
- Maintain compatibility with the existing configuration validation performed using Zod.

## Implementation Details

- **Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Add logic in the `main` function to check for the `--config-override` flag. If the flag is present, the next argument should be a JSON string.
  - Parse the JSON string and merge its key/value pairs with the current configuration loaded via `dotenv` and validated by Zod. In case of conflicts, the override values take precedence for that execution only.
  - Ensure that any JSON parsing error is caught and logged using the existing `logError` function, then terminate the execution in a controlled manner.

- **Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add new unit tests to verify that when the `--config-override` flag is provided, configuration values are updated accordingly in the application's runtime. For example, overriding `GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` with a test value and verifying that it appears in the diagnostics output via the `--diagnostics` flag.

- **README File Updates (README.md):**
  - Update the CLI Commands section to include the new `--config-override <jsonString>` flag with a clear description:
    - Example: "--config-override <jsonString>: Override configuration settings for the current execution. The JSON string should contain valid key/value pairs that will take precedence over the default configuration."

- **Dependencies File Updates (package.json):**
  - No new dependencies are required. This feature utilizes existing modules (such as `dotenv` and `zod`) and leverages the current CLI processing in the `main` function.

## Success Criteria & Verification

- When the `--config-override` flag is provided with a valid JSON string, the effective configuration during execution reflects the overridden values.
- If an invalid JSON string is provided, the system logs an error using `logError` and exits gracefully.
- Automated tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` verify both successful overrides and error handling scenarios.

## Dependencies & Constraints

- The feature is confined to modifications within the source file, test file, and README. No new files are created.
- The configuration schema remains unchanged; only the run-time values are updated based on the override input.
- The feature maintains compatibility with Node 20+ and ECMAScript Module standards.

By providing dynamic configuration overrides, this feature empowers users to fine-tune and test different setups quickly, aligning with the mission of enhanced agentic flexibility in automated workflows.
