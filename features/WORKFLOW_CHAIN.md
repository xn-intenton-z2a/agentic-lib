# WORKFLOW_CHAIN Feature Specification

This feature describes the interaction between the library, sources, and publish web workflows, creating a continuous chain from source material to published web content. The workflows work together to maintain and publish feature documentation, with potential extensions for OWL semantic markup, visible and metadata attributions, and document traceability.

## Scenario: Source Material Collection

**Given** the source worker workflow is triggered,

**Then** it:
- Maintains the `SOURCES.md` file with URLs and metadata
- Updates source entries with new URLs and metadata
- Validates source entries for proper formatting
- Ensures sources have appropriate licensing information

## Scenario: Library Document Generation

**Given** the library worker workflow is triggered,

**When** source entries are available in `SOURCES.md`,

**Then** it:
- Crawls URLs from source entries to gather content
- Generates document summaries using AI
- Creates or updates feature documents in the features directory
- Manages document lifecycle (creation, updates, deletion)
- Handles timeouts gracefully for build, test, and main scripts

## Scenario: Web Content Publication

**Given** the publish web workflow is triggered,

**When** feature documents exist in the features directory,

**Then** it:
- Converts markdown feature files to HTML
- Generates an index page with links to all features
- Deploys to GitHub Pages for public access
- Makes the content available at a published URL

## Scenario: Workflow Chain Interaction

**Given** all three workflows are configured in the repository,

**Then** they interact in the following way:
1. The Source Worker maintains the `SOURCES.md` file with URLs and metadata
2. The Library Worker uses the sources to create/update feature documents in the features directory
3. The Publish Web workflow converts these feature documents to HTML and publishes them to GitHub Pages

## Scenario: OWL Semantic Markup Extension

**Given** the feature chain is operational,

**When** OWL semantic markup extensions are implemented,

**Then** the published HTML is enhanced with:
- RDFa attributes in the HTML templates
- Semantic relationships between features using OWL properties
- Feature classes and properties defined in an ontology file
- Machine-readable metadata that enables advanced search and reasoning

## Scenario: Document Traceability Implementation

**Given** the feature chain with OWL extensions is operational,

**Then** document traceability is implemented through:
- Provenance information using OWL properties
- Links between features and their source material with semantic relationships
- Version history and change tracking metadata
- Clear attribution chains from source to published content

## Scenario: Visible and Metadata Attributions

**Given** the feature chain with OWL extensions is operational,

**Then** attributions are implemented as:
- Visible attribution sections in the HTML
- Machine-readable attribution metadata using RDFa
- Links to license information with semantic properties
- Clear citation of original sources and modifications

| Workflow | Input File | Output |
|----------|------------|--------|
