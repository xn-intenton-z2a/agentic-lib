# CHAT_AGENT

## Overview
This feature integrates a chat agent functionality into the existing agentic-lib. Users can now interact with the system in a conversational manner by leveraging the OpenAI Chat Completions API. The chat agent will complement the traditional agentic commands, allowing for context-aware feedback, GitHub issue outline generation, and guided automated workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Modifications:**
  - Extend `src/lib/main.js` to add a new function `chatAgent`. This function will:
    - Accept a JSON payload (via a new CLI flag `--chat`).
    - Utilize the `openai` package with the `OPENAI_API_KEY` to generate a chat completion response.
    - Log the start and end of the process using existing `logInfo` and `logError` utilities.
  - Update the main CLI logic in `src/lib/main.js` to detect and handle the `--chat` flag. When triggered, it should call the `chatAgent` function and output its response to the user.

- **Testing Enhancements:**
  - Update `tests/unit/main.test.js` to include unit tests for the new `chatAgent` function. Ensure tests simulate both successful API responses (using the existing mock for `openai`) and error conditions.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Enhance the `README.md` to include usage examples for the new `--chat` flag. Describe how the chat agent improves the user experience by allowing natural language interactions for generating insights and GitHub issues outlines.

## Benefits & Success Criteria
- **Enhanced Interaction:** Provides a natural conversational interface, making it easier for users to interact with the system.
- **Versatility:** Supports various use cases including debugging, issue generation, and automated guidance.
- **Robustness:** Comprehensive unit tests ensure that both successful responses and error conditions are handled gracefully.

## Dependencies & Considerations
- This feature continues to rely on the already included `openai` package. It conforms to Node 20 and ECMAScript Module standards.
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing features such as the agenticHandler.
