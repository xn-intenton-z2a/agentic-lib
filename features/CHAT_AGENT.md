# Overview

This feature fully implements and refines the chat agent integration. It introduces a new function, `chatAgent`, which leverages the OpenAI Chat Completions API to provide an interactive conversational interface when the CLI flag `--chat` is used.

# Implementation Details

## Source File Modifications (src/lib/main.js)
- **New Function `chatAgent`:**
  - Create the `chatAgent` function that accepts either a string message or a JSON payload.
  - Within this function, use the `openai` package to call the Chat Completions API. Wrap the API call in a try/catch block to handle errors gracefully.
  - Utilize existing utilities `logInfo` and `logError` for logging the start of a call, successful responses, and any errors encountered.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update the CLI argument parser to detect a new flag `--chat`.
  - When `--chat` is provided, invoke the `chatAgent` function, process the returned response, and print the formatted chat output.

## Testing Enhancements (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **Unit Tests for `chatAgent`:**
  - Add tests that simulate successful chat interactions by mocking the OpenAI API. 
  - Ensure errors are caught and logged when invalid inputs are provided, by testing error paths in `chatAgent`.

## Documentation Updates (README.md)
- **Usage Section:**
  - Update the documentation to include examples of using the new `--chat` flag.
  - Explain how the chat agent offers a more natural language interface, enhancing user interaction with the library.

## Dependencies
- This feature relies on the existing `openai` package and adheres to the Node 20 and ECMAScript Module standards, ensuring compatibility with current dependencies.

# Benefits & Success Criteria

- **Enhanced Interaction:** Implements a conversational CLI interface to improve user experience.
- **Robust Error Handling:** All API calls and input validations are logged and managed gracefully.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** New unit tests will cover both normal and error scenarios for the chat agent functionality.

# Verification & Acceptance

- The CLI flag `--chat` should correctly invoke the `chatAgent` function and output a formatted chat response.
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` must pass, confirming both successful and error-case behaviors of the chat agent.
- The README must be updated to reflect the new functionality and command usage examples.
