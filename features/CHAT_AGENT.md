# CHAT_AGENT

## Overview
This updated feature enhances the existing chat agent integration by providing a dedicated CLI flag `--chat` that triggers a conversational interface using the OpenAI Chat Completions API. This conversational interface will be integrated alongside the current agentic commands, offering users a natural language interface to perform actions, generate GitHub issue outlines, and receive context-aware feedback.

## Implementation Details
### Source File Modifications (src/lib/main.js)
- **New Function `chatAgent`:**
  - Create a new function called `chatAgent` that accepts a JSON payload or string message and utilizes the `openai` package to generate chat completions.
  - The function should wrap the API call in proper try/catch blocks and use the existing `logInfo` and `logError` utilities to log the beginning and the result or errors.
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update the CLI argument parsing to check for the new `--chat` flag.
  - When identified, call the `chatAgent` function and format the output for the user.

### Testing Enhancements (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **Unit Tests for `chatAgent`:**
  - Add tests that simulate a successful chat completion response using the existing OpenAI mock.
  - Include tests for error conditions to ensure the function logs errors correctly and handles unexpected inputs gracefully.

### Documentation Updates (README.md)
- **Usage Section:**
  - Update the CLI usage documentation to include examples for using the `--chat` flag.
  - Describe the benefits of the chat integration, such as enabling conversational interactions and generating dynamic insights.

## Dependencies
- The feature relies on the existing `openai` package, ensuring compatibility with Node 20 and ECMAScript Module standards. No new dependencies are added.

## Benefits & Success Criteria
- **Enhanced Usability:** Provides users with natural language capabilities to interact with the system.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Clearly logs errors and API failures to aid in debugging.
- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests will cover both success and failure cases of the chat agent, ensuring stable behavior.

## Verification & Acceptance
- The `--chat` flag should invoke the new function and display a properly formatted response.
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` should pass, confirming that both successful and error scenarios are handled correctly.
- Documentation in README.md will be updated to reflect the new usage of the chat agent feature.
