# CHAT_AGENT

## Overview
This feature introduces an autonomous chat agent that leverages the OpenAI Chat Completions API. The chat agent will allow the system to process textual inputs (e.g., log summaries, SQS digest messages) and generate insights, automated responses, or even GitHub issue outlines. This extension enriches the agentic workflow by enabling natural language processing directly within the repository without complex external integrations.

## Implementation Details
- **New Entry Point:** Add a new function `chatAgent` in the source file (e.g., `src/lib/chatAgent.js`) that will serve as the integration point for the OpenAI Chat Completions API.
- **API Integration:** Utilize the `openai` package to create chat completions. Make sure to pull configuration (e.g., OpenAI API key) from the environment as done for other configurations in the project.
- **CLI Support:** Integrate the new functionality with the main CLI. Introduce a new flag (e.g., `--chat`) that triggers the `chatAgent` function to process a given payload or sample text input.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement error handling consistent with `logInfo` and `logError` functions. Ensure that each step is logged for diagnostics and troubleshooting.
- **Testing:** Add unit tests in the `tests/unit/` directory (for example, in `chatAgent.test.js`). Tests should simulate both successful API responses and error conditions.

## Benefits & Success Criteria
- **Enhanced Automation:** Automates the generation of GitHub issue outlines and response strategies based on processed log data and SQS event summaries.
- **User Experience:** Improves the user interaction by providing intelligent feedback and actionable insights.
- **Maintainability:** The feature is developed as a self-contained module that adheres to the existing project structure and follows the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- **Testability:** Comprehensive unit tests ensure reliability and ease of future enhancements.

## Dependencies & Considerations
- Ensure the `openai` package is correctly configured and used without affecting existing functionality.
- Maintain compatibility with Node 20 and the ECMAScript Module standard.
- No changes to existing features are required; this is an additive, isolated feature that aligns with the repository's agentic mature vision.
