# CHAT_AGENT

## Overview
This feature refines the existing chat agent integration by fully implementing the `chatAgent` function. The chat agent will offer an interactive conversational interface through a dedicated CLI flag `--chat` which leverages the OpenAI Chat Completions API. The new implementation will provide robust error handling, detailed logging, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Implementation Details
### Source File Modifications (src/lib/main.js)
- **New Function `chatAgent`:**
  - Add a new function `chatAgent` that accepts a string message or JSON payload.
  - Use the `openai` package to send requests to the Chat Completions API within a try/catch block.
  - Utilize existing utilities (`logInfo` and `logError`) to log the start, successful response, and any errors.
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Extend the CLI argument parsing to detect the `--chat` flag.
  - When the flag is detected, call `chatAgent` and print the formatted chat response to the user.

## Testing Enhancements
### Test File Modifications (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **Unit Tests for `chatAgent`:**
  - Create tests to simulate successful chat completion responses using mocks of the OpenAI API.
  - Add error condition tests to confirm that errors are logged and handled correctly if invalid input is provided.

## Documentation Updates
### README Modifications (README.md)
- **Usage Section:**
  - Update the CLI documentation to include examples of using the new `--chat` flag.
  - Explain the benefits of conversational interactions enabled by the chat agent.

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies are added. The feature will rely on the existing `openai` package and remain compatible with Node 20 and ESM standards.

## Benefits & Success Criteria
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides a natural language interface for interacting with the repository.
- **Robust Error Handling & Logging:** Ensures that all API calls and input validations are logged and any errors are handled gracefully.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Unit tests will validate both normal and edge-case behaviors of the `chatAgent` function.

## Verification & Acceptance
- The `--chat` flag should invoke the `chatAgent` function and output a correctly formatted chat response.
- All unit tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` should pass, validating both successful chat interactions and error scenarios.
- Documentation in README.md must be updated to describe the new flag and functionality.
