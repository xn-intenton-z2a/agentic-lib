# CHAT_AGENT

## Overview
This feature enhances the existing autonomous agent capabilities by integrating a dedicated chat agent that leverages the OpenAI Chat Completions API. In addition to processing simple commands (as handled by agenticHandler), the chat agent will provide context-aware, natural language responses. By triggering this new behavior via an additional CLI flag, users can easily obtain chat-based insights, generate GitHub issue outlines, or receive automated guidance within a single, self-contained repository.

## Implementation Details
- **New Entry Point:** Extend the main source file (`src/lib/main.js`) by adding a new function `chatAgent`.
  - This function will serve as the integration point for the OpenAI Chat Completions API.
  - It will accept a JSON payload (via the new CLI flag `--chat`) and return a chat completion response.
- **CLI Integration:** Update the main CLI logic in `src/lib/main.js` to handle a new flag `--chat` that triggers the `chatAgent` function.
- **API Integration:** Use the already included `openai` package to create chat completions. Make sure to obtain necessary configuration (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) from environment variables, in the same manner as other configuration settings.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Align error handling with existing patterns using `logError` and `logInfo`. Each step, from invocation to API response, should be logged appropriately.
- **Testing:** Update the test file (`tests/unit/main.test.js`) to include tests for the new `chatAgent` function. Tests should simulate both successful and error conditions of the API call.
- **Documentation Updates:** Enhance the README file to include usage examples for the new `--chat` flag and a brief description of the chat agent functionality.

## Benefits & Success Criteria
- **Enhanced Automation:** Provides an interactive chat-based permission for generating issue outlines or debugging insights, complementing the existing agentic command processor.
- **Improved User Experience:** Offers a more natural interface for users to engage with automated workflows.
- **Maintainability:** Developed as a module within the existing source file, following established design patterns and guidelines from CONTRIBUTING.md.
- **Testability:** Comprehensive unit tests will ensure that chat completions are correctly integrated and robust to error conditions.

## Dependencies & Considerations
- The feature relies on the `openai` package which is already present in the dependencies.
- The new function must adhere to Node 20 and ECMAScript Module standards.
- Existing features (e.g., agenticHandler) should continue to function without interference, ensuring backward compatibility.
