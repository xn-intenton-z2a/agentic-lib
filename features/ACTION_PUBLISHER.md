# Overview
This feature introduces support for publishing the JavaScript library as a GitHub Workflow Action. By incorporating this functionality, the library can be seamlessly integrated into GitHub Actions, allowing users to invoke its features directly via workflow calls. This aligns with our mission to empower autonomous, agentic workflows.

# Objectives
- **Workflow Integration:** Package the JS library so that it can be executed as a native GitHub Workflow Action.
- **Metadata Injection:** Create and maintain an action metadata file (action.yml) with required inputs/outputs enabling smooth invocation via GitHub.
- **Documentation Update:** Enhance README and other documentation to clearly explain how to consume the published action.
- **Testing and Validation:** Implement tests and validation steps to ensure that the action performs as expected when invoked within a GitHub workflow.

# Implementation Strategy
1. **Action Metadata File:**
   - Create an action definition file (action.yml) in the repository root. This file should specify the inputs, outputs, and main execution script (e.g. src/lib/main.js) for the action.
   - Include default values and descriptions that are consistent with current usage patterns.

2. **Packaging and Distribution:**
   - Update the build and release processes to include the action metadata. Ensure that the published package complies with GitHub Action guidelines.
   - Integrate the new feature with existing deployment and tagging mechanisms.

3. **Documentation and Usage Examples:**
   - Update the README and other relevant documentation to include installation and usage instructions for the published action.
   - Provide sample YAML snippets demonstrating how to call the action in a workflow.

4. **Testing and Continuous Integration:**
   - Add tests to verify that the action metadata is correctly formatted and that the action executes as expected on GitHub runners.
   - Include both unit and integration tests in the CI pipeline to validate the workflow action under various scenarios.

# Acceptance Criteria
- The JS library is successfully packaged as a GitHub Workflow Action with a valid action.yml file.
- Documentation is updated with clear instructions and examples for using the action.
- CI/CD pipelines verify the integrity and performance of the action through comprehensive tests.
- The feature is fully compatible with the library's mission of supporting autonomous workflows and continuous evolution of the code base.
