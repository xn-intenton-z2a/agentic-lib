# Flow Orchestrator

## Overview
The Flow Orchestrator feature consolidates several core elements of autonomous workflow management into a single, streamlined interface. By merging the functionalities of LLM delegation, workflow monitoring, and GitHub Action publishing, this feature provides a robust orchestration layer that simplifies decision-making, monitoring, and deployment operations. It ensures that autonomous workflows can reliably communicate, self-review, and evolve with minimal friction.

## Objectives
- **Unified LLM Delegation:** Merge enhanced input validation and error handling from the existing LLM Delegator to seamlessly invoke decision-making processes via the Chat Completions API.
- **Real-Time Workflow Monitoring:** Incorporate continuous monitoring of GitHub Actions workflows, capturing performance metrics, error rates, and execution anomalies in real-time.
- **Automated Action Publishing:** Integrate support for publishing the JavaScript library as a GitHub Workflow Action, enabling direct invocation from workflows and ensuring easy deployment.
- **Enhanced Caching & Logging:** Utilize in-memory caching with TTL support for LLM responses and detailed logging to improve performance and traceability across autonomous operations.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Consolidated API Invocation:**
   - Leverage existing mechanisms from LLM Delegator to enforce prompt validation, auto-conversion, and direct API communication with OpenAI.
   - Retain structured error reporting and detailed logging.
2. **Workflow Telemetry Integration:**
   - Integrate workflow monitoring to collect key performance indicators (KPIs) and detect anomalies.
   - Use these metrics to trigger automated issue creation if thresholds are breached, thereby ensuring continuous improvement.
3. **Action Publishing Module:**
   - Bundle the logic necessary to package and publish the JS library as a GitHub Workflow Action.
   - Update metadata (action.yml) and documentation to reflect new deployment instructions.
4. **Testing & Validation:**
   - Extend unit and integration tests to cover prompt handling, API communications, caching behavior, and telemetry processing.
   - Ensure compatibility with existing autonomous workflow integrations and CI/CD processes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The feature successfully integrates LLM delegation with real-time workflow monitoring and action publishing.
- Detailed logs and cache behaviors are observed during operation, with seamless fallback on API errors.
- Automated tests validate all edge cases, including input validation, caching TTL, and error handling.
- The solution aligns with the mission to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve agentic workflows with minimal manual intervention.
