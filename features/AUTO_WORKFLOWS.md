# AUTO_WORKFLOWS

## Overview
The AUTO_WORKFLOWS feature consolidates autonomous workflow management, issue lifecycle handling, and LLM delegation into one unified module. This feature brings together functionalities from the previous ISSUE_MANAGER, ISSUE_CREATOR, and FLOW_ORCHESTRATOR, streamlining GitHub issue creation, review processes, and real-time workflow monitoring. The feature supports robust error handling, caching, and telemetry, thereby enhancing continuous code evolution with minimal manual intervention.

## Objectives
- **Unified Issue Lifecycle:** Merge issue batching, composition, review, and creation into a cohesive process for managing and automating GitHub issue flows.
- **Autonomous Workflow Orchestration:** Integrate LLM delegation, real-time monitoring of workflows, and automated action publishing to ensure autonomous operations across the repository.
- **Robust Validation and Caching:** Implement enhanced input validation, in-memory caching with TTL support, and detailed logging to improve performance and traceability.
- **Enhanced Integration:** Seamlessly interface with existing CI/CD pipelines and GitHub Actions workflows to trigger automated reviews and updates aligned with the repositoryâ€™s mission.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Consolidation of Components:**
   - Integrate existing logic from ISSUE_MANAGER and ISSUE_CREATOR to handle the entire lifecycle of GitHub issues.
   - Merge FLOW_ORCHESTRATOR functionalities to manage LLM delegation, including prompt validation, auto-conversion, and caching.

2. **Workflow Integration:**
   - Combine the orchestration of issue creation with real-time monitoring and telemetry collection.
   - Update configuration options for scheduling, caching TTL, and error handling to match performance benchmarks.

3. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests covering input edge cases, caching behavior, telemetry data, and API failure scenarios.
   - Ensure that the consolidated workflow meets detailed acceptance criteria and aligns with agentic-lib's mission of continuous, autonomous repository evolution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Successful integration of issue lifecycle management and autonomous workflow orchestration within a single, unified feature.
- Fully functional in-memory caching with configurable TTL and robust error logging.
- Automated and structured generation of GitHub issues based on composite prompts from the LLM delegation mechanism.
- Seamless integration with existing GitHub Actions workflows and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring continuous monitoring and self-healing capabilities.
