# SIMULATE_LOAD Feature Specification

## Overview
This update enhances the dynamic load simulation mode when the CLI flag --simulate-load is invoked. In addition to triggering a batch of dummy commands and optionally specifying the number of commands to simulate (default is 10), this update further computes detailed timing metrics for each command call. The simulation summary now includes not only the total number of commands, total combined execution time, and average execution time per command, but also the minimum and maximum execution times. This provides developers with greater insight into performance variability and helps identify potential anomalies.

## Implementation Details
- Update the main CLI processing in the source file (src/lib/main.js) to detect the --simulate-load flag.
- In the simulation loop that processes dummy commands via the existing agenticHandler, capture individual execution times.
- After processing all commands, calculate the following statistics:
  - Total number of commands processed
  - Total execution time (sum of execution times)
  - Average execution time per command
  - Minimum execution time recorded
  - Maximum execution time recorded
- Update the simulation summary output to include these additional metrics.
- Extend the unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js to verify that when the --simulate-load flag is used (with both default and custom number of commands), the output includes correct values for average, minimum, and maximum execution times.
- Update documentation in README.md under the CLI Behavior section to detail the enhanced simulation mode and explain the significance of each of the new metrics.

## User Scenarios & Acceptance Criteria
- When the CLI is invoked with --simulate-load and no argument, it runs 10 dummy commands and outputs a summary that includes total commands processed, total execution time, average execution time, as well as the minimum and maximum execution times.
- When the CLI is invoked with --simulate-load <number>, that specified number of commands is processed, and the output summary accurately reflects the new timing statistics.
- Unit tests cover both the default and custom numeric parameter scenarios, ensuring that the new metrics (min and max execution times) are calculated correctly alongside the average.
- Documentation is updated to inform users how to interpret the enhanced simulation summary.

This enhancement aligns with the mission of improving observability and performance insight for developers using agenticâ€‘lib in their autonomous workflows.
