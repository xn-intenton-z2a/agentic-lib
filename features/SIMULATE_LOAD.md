# SIMULATE LOAD Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI flag "--simulate-load" to simulate heavy load processing. When this flag is provided, the system will execute a batch of dummy commands to measure performance and aggregate processing time. It is designed to test the robustness and observability of the agentic-lib during high volume command processing, and to provide insights into performance under load.

## Implementation Details
The source file (src/lib/main.js) will be updated to recognize the "--simulate-load" flag. When detected, a predefined batch of dummy commands (for example, 10 commands) will be processed using the existing agenticHandler function. The start and end times will be recorded to calculate the total execution time. The global callCount will be incremented accordingly, and a summary message including the total number of commands processed and execution time will be logged.

The test file (tests/unit/main.test.js) will be updated to include a test case for the new "--simulate-load" flag. The test will verify that the load simulation scenario executes as expected and that the output message contains the load simulation summary.

The README file (README.md) will be updated in the CLI Behavior section to document the new "--simulate-load" flag, explaining its purpose and usage in simulating a high load environment.

## User Scenarios and Acceptance Criteria
- Given the CLI is invoked with the "--simulate-load" flag, the system should start processing a batch of dummy commands.
- The processing should measure and log the total execution time along with the total number of commands processed.
- The output should include a clear summary message indicating that the load simulation has completed.
- The test suite should include a new test case that triggers the "--simulate-load" flag and verifies the proper simulation summary message is logged.
- Documentation in the README file must be updated to include the description and usage of the "--simulate-load" flag.

This feature aligns with the mission of building resilient and observable workflows and provides a practical tool for performance testing within the agentic-lib repository.
