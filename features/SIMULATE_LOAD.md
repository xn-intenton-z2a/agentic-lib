# SIMULATE_LOAD Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the existing simulate load functionality by introducing a dynamic load simulation mode via the CLI flag "--simulate-load". In addition to triggering a batch of dummy commands, users can now optionally specify the number of commands to simulate. When the flag is supplied without an argument, a default of 10 commands is processed. This extension not only tests system robustness under configurable load but also provides insights into performance with varying command counts.

## Implementation Details
- Update the main CLI in src/lib/main.js to check for the "--simulate-load" flag. If detected, determine if a numeric argument follows the flag; if absent, default to 10 commands.
- The simulation loop calls the existing agenticHandler function iteratively with a dummy command (such as "dummy"). Timing is recorded to compute the total execution time for the simulated load.
- Increment the global invocation counter for each processed command.
- In tests (tests/unit/main.test.js), add a new test case to trigger the "--simulate-load" flag with and without a numeric parameter and verify that the output includes a summary message with the correct number of commands and execution time.
- Update the README (README.md) under the CLI Behavior section to document the usage of "--simulate-load", including the optional numeric parameter for command count.

## User Scenarios & Acceptance Criteria
- When invoked with "--simulate-load" and no argument, the CLI processes 10 dummy commands and logs a summary with total commands and execution time.
- When invoked with "--simulate-load <number>", the system processes the specified number of dummy commands.
- The test suite includes cases verifying both default and custom load simulations.
- Documentation is updated to reflect the new parameterized load simulation mode.

This feature aligns with the mission of providing resilient and observable workflows in a configurable and testable manner.
