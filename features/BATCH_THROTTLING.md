# Batch Throttling and Deduplication Enhancement

This feature upgrades the batch processing logic to introduce two key aspects: enforcing a maximum limit on the number of commands and filtering out duplicate commands in a batch. Both capabilities act to improve overall performance and reliability by ensuring that only a valid, unique set of commands is processed.

## Objectives

- Enforce a command limit based on the environment variable MAX_BATCH_COMMANDS. If the number of commands in the payload exceeds this limit, the batch is immediately rejected with an error message.
- Scan the payloadâ€™s commands array for duplicate entries. Filter out duplicates so that each unique command is processed only once, thus avoiding redundant processing and unintended increment of the invocation counter.
- Maintain compatibility with existing performance metrics tracking and logging details, ensuring that any deduplication logic is seamlessly integrated with the current processing flow.
- Update the documentation in the README to clearly describe both the batch throttling and deduplication behavior when processing a batch of commands.

## Implementation Details

- In the agenticHandler function, check if the payload includes a "commands" array. First, verify the count against the MAX_BATCH_COMMANDS limit if the environment variable is set. If the limit is exceeded, return an error without processing the commands.
- Next, scan the commands array for duplicates. Remove duplicate entries before processing to minimize unintended side-effects and reduce resource usage.
- Continue processing the filtered list of commands, incrementing the global invocation counter and computing individual execution times as before. Maintain the aggregated performanceMetrics if batch processing is performed.
- Update unit tests to ensure that a payload with duplicate commands results in only one execution per unique command. Also, verify that the throttling logic still properly rejects payloads exceeding the maximum command limit.

## Success Criteria

- Payloads containing duplicate commands are processed by executing only unique commands, with duplicates filtered out without error.
- When MAX_BATCH_COMMANDS is set, payloads exceeding the limit are rejected with a clear error message.
- The aggregated performance metrics remain accurate after deduplication, and unit tests confirm the expected behavior.
- README documentation is updated to include details on both batch size throttling and command deduplication.
