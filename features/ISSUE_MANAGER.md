# Issue Manager

## Overview
The Issue Manager feature consolidates all issue-related functionalities of the repository into a single, unified module. It merges the capabilities of batch issue generation, automated issue composition, issue review, and issue creation into one streamlined process. This unified feature reduces complexity and enhances maintainability by handling all aspects of GitHub issue lifecycle in a coherent workflow.

## Objectives
- **Unified Issue Lifecycle:** Combine the responsibilities of generating, composing, reviewing, and creating GitHub issues into a single feature.
- **Enhanced Automation:** Leverage the Chat Completions API to parse composite prompts and generate precise, structured issue drafts ready for automated creation.
- **Robust Validation and Error Handling:** Integrate improved input validation for prompts and error logging to handle potential failures at any stage of the issue pipeline.
- **Seamless Integration:** Interface with existing GitHub Actions and repository workflows, ensuring that issues are automatically logged, tracked, and fed back into the autonomous update cycle.
- **Actionable Feedback:** Allow for detailed reporting of issue status and include actionable recommendations and fixes to support continuous code evolution.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Merge Existing Capabilities:**
   - **Issue Batcher:** Consolidate prompt splitting and multi-issue generation logic.
   - **Issue Composer:** Integrate log aggregation and error summarization into comprehensive issue descriptions.
   - **Issue Reviewer:** Embed automated review of code changes, ensuring that fixes are accurately reflected in issue updates.
   - **Issue Creator:** Retain the functionality to trigger GitHub issue creation but in a more decoupled and manageable manner.

2. **Workflow Integration:**
   - Ensure that the Issue Manager feature interacts seamlessly with the autonomous workflow orchestrator and other core modules (e.g., the security scanning and flow orchestrator features).
   - Create detailed logs and structured JSON reports to support traceability and debugging.

3. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to simulate real-world scenarios, including input edge cases and API failures.
   - Validate the complete issue lifecycle from composite prompt input to the final creation of GitHub issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Successful consolidation of issue management features with full coverage of batch generation, composition, review, and creation.
- Automated generation of well-structured GitHub issue drafts that pass schema validation and include actionable feedback.
- Robust error handling and detailed logging to ensure reliability within the autonomous workflow environment.
- Seamless integration with the repositoryâ€™s mission to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve code.
