# RUNTIME_MONITOR Feature Specification

This feature introduces a new CLI flag, `--runtime`, to enhance the observability of the agentic-lib by providing extended runtime diagnostics. The new functionality supplements the existing `--status` and `--diagnostics` flags by including memory usage, load averages, and other process-level metrics. It is designed to be achieved within the existing source file, test file, and README updates.

## Objectives

- **Extended Diagnostics:** Provide detailed runtime diagnostics including memory usage and system load as part of the agentic-lib's monitoring capabilities.
- **User Accessibility:** Enable users to invoke the new `--runtime` flag via the CLI to quickly obtain extended system and process information.
- **Enhanced Observability:** Complement the current status and diagnostics outputs with additional key metrics such as `process.memoryUsage()` and OS load average obtained via Node's `os` module.

## Implementation Details

- **Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Add a new function `runtimeMonitorHandler()` that gathers runtime metrics:
    - Use `process.memoryUsage()` to capture memory statistics.
    - Use Node's `os` module to obtain load averages.
    - Merge these metrics with the previously provided status information.
  - Update the main CLI logic to check for the `--runtime` flag. If detected, call `runtimeMonitorHandler()` and output the diagnostics in JSON format.

- **Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add new tests to verify that when `--runtime` is supplied as a command line argument, the output contains properties such as `memoryUsage` and `loadAverage`.
  - Ensure test isolation by resetting any necessary global counters and using spies to capture console output.

- **README File Updates (README.md):**
  - Update the CLI Commands section to include the new `--runtime` flag with a description similar to:
    - `--runtime`: Display extended runtime diagnostics including memory usage and system load averages.
  - Ensure the new documentation is clear and consistent with the other CLI flags.

## Success Criteria & Verification

- When the `--runtime` flag is provided, the CLI outputs a JSON object containing properties such as `memoryUsage` (with detailed memory statistics) and `loadAverage` (array representing system load averages).
- The new function `runtimeMonitorHandler()` should integrate seamlessly with the existing status handler, offering additional runtime metrics without interfering with other flags.
- Tests must verify that the output of the `--runtime` flag contains the necessary new fields.

## Dependencies & Constraints

- The feature adheres to the constraint that only existing files (source, tests, and README) are modified.
- The added code uses native Node.js modules (`os`) and existing logging and status functions, ensuring no new external dependencies are introduced.

By integrating the `--runtime` flag, this feature enhances the agentic-lib's monitoring capabilities in a valuable yet lightweight manner, aligning with the mission to provide transparent and autonomous workflow diagnostics.
