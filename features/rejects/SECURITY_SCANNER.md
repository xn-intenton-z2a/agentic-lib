# Security Scanner

## Overview
The Security Scanner feature integrates a robust, automated vulnerability detection mechanism into agentic-lib. This feature reviews source code, configuration files, and dependencies to identify potential security flaws and code vulnerabilities. It leverages both static analysis techniques and configurable scanning tools to detect issues, thereby enabling proactive remediation and enhancing repository safety.

## Objectives
- **Automated Vulnerability Detection:** Scan code and dependency lists to detect known security issues and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Actionable Feedback:** Generate detailed reports outlining the vulnerabilities, affected areas in the codebase, and actionable remediation steps.
- **Seamless Issue Integration:** Automatically create GitHub issues for critical security findings using existing ISSUE_CREATOR and ISSUE_BATCHER integrations.
- **Configurable Scanning:** Allow configuration of scan frequency, thresholds for alerts, and integration with external security advisories.
- **Enhanced Traceability:** Log all scanning events and store historical data to track improvement trends and ensure timely updates.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Integration of Scanning Tools:**
   - Incorporate static analysis tools and security plugins (e.g., eslint-plugin-security) to identify common coding vulnerabilities.
   - Implement custom scanning logic to parse dependency files (like package.json) for outdated or vulnerable packages.

2. **Report Generation and Automation:**
   - Generate detailed JSON reports that catalog detected vulnerabilities along with recommended fixes.
   - Leverage existing logging and workflow mechanisms to output scan results in a structured, human-readable format.

3. **Issue Creation Workflow:**
   - Use existing ISSUE_CREATOR and ISSUE_BATCHER features to automatically generate GitHub issues for high-severity vulnerabilities.
   - Include comprehensive context such as code snippets, dependency details, and remediation suggestions in the issue descriptions.

4. **Configuration and Scheduling:**
   - Provide configuration options via environment variables or configuration files to customize scan frequency, alert thresholds, and scanning scope.
   - Integrate the Security Scanner as a step in CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous security monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The Security Scanner successfully identifies known vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations in both code and dependencies.
- Detailed reports are generated, highlighting affected components and suggested remediation steps.
- High-severity issues trigger the automated creation of GitHub issues through the existing issue management workflows.
- Logs and historical scan data are maintained for traceability and trend analysis.
- The feature integrates seamlessly with agentic-lib's mission of supporting autonomous workflows for continuous code evolution and resilience.
