# LOGGING_ENHANCEMENT Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the existing logging functionality by introducing an optional correlation identifier (e.g., REQUEST_ID) to be included in every log message. This improves traceability, especially when the library is used in distributed or automated workflows. By embedding a unique request identifier into each log record when available, developers and operators can easily correlate log entries related to a specific invocation or workflow execution.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Modifications (src/lib/main.js)
- **Enhanced Log Functions:**
  - Update `logInfo` and `logError` to check for an environment variable (e.g., `REQUEST_ID`).
  - If set, include an additional property `requestId` in the log output.
  - Ensure the new field does not affect existing functionality when the variable is not set.
  
### Testing Enhancements (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **New Test Cases for Logging Enhancement:**
  - Add tests to verify that when the `REQUEST_ID` environment variable is provided, the log output from `logInfo` and `logError` includes a `requestId` field with the correct value.
  - Ensure that existing log outputs remain unaffected when `REQUEST_ID` is not set.

### Documentation Updates (README.md)
- **Logging Section Update:**
  - Document the new logging behavior and describe how to set the `REQUEST_ID` environment variable.
  - Provide usage examples demonstrating the enhanced log output.

## Benefits & Success Criteria
- **Improved Traceability:** Makes it easier to correlate and analyze logs for individual commands or workflows.
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Assists in troubleshooting by linking log entries with specific requests.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing functionality is preserved if `REQUEST_ID` is not defined.
- **Testable:** New unit tests will verify the presence of the request identifier under the appropriate conditions.

## Verification & Acceptance
- The `logInfo` and `logError` functions must include the `requestId` property in the log object when `REQUEST_ID` is set.
- Tests must pass verifying the enhanced log output behavior.
- Documentation in README is updated with clear instructions on using the enhanced logging mechanism.
