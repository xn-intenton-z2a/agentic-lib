# CHAT_AGENT Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature implements a conversational chat agent within the CLI interface using the OpenAI Chat Completions API. The chat agent provides an interactive conversational experience when the user supplies the `--chat` flag. This update refines and completes the earlier design by adding the missing implementation of the `chatAgent` function, integrating robust error handling, and extending the existing test suite and documentation.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Modifications (src/lib/main.js)
- **New Function `chatAgent`:**
  - Implement the `chatAgent` function which accepts a string message or a JSON payload as input.
  - Use the `openai` package to call the Chat Completions API with the provided payload. Ensure the API call is wrapped in a try/catch block to handle errors gracefully.
  - Log the initiation and the outcome of the API call using the existing `logInfo` and `logError` utilities.
  - Return the response from the API in a formatted manner.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update the argument parser to recognize a new `--chat` flag.
  - When the flag is present, invoke the `chatAgent` function, process its response and print the output to the console.

### Testing Enhancements (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **Unit Tests for `chatAgent`:**
  - Add tests simulating both a successful chat interaction and failure scenarios by mocking the OpenAI Chat Completions API.
  - For successful interactions, mock a response that returns a JSON containing a message.
  - For failure cases, simulate API errors and ensure the function logs the error and rethrows or handles it appropriately.

### Documentation Updates (README.md)
- **Usage Section:**
  - Add examples on how to use the new `--chat` flag.
  - Explain the purpose of the chat agent and illustrate example commands to invoke it.

### Dependencies
- This feature relies on the existing `openai` package. No new dependencies are introduced.

## Benefits & Success Criteria

- **Enhanced Interaction:** Provides a natural language conversational interface via the CLI, improving user experience.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Incorporates thorough error checking and logging to ensure stability and clear diagnostics in case of issues with API calls.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** New unit tests cover both successful responses and error paths, ensuring the chat functionality maintains high reliability.

## Verification & Acceptance

- The `--chat` flag should correctly trigger the `chatAgent` function and print the formatted response from the OpenAI API.
- Unit tests for the `chatAgent` function must pass, verifying both successful and error handling scenarios.
- The README documentation must be updated with usage examples and details regarding the chat agent functionality.
