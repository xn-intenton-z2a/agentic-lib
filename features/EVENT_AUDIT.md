# EVENT_AUDIT

## Overview
This feature adds an audit logging mechanism to the agentic-lib. Each command processed by the agenticHandler will now produce an audit trail record that includes the timestamp, the command input, execution status, and processing time. The audit trail is attached to the response when verbose diagnostics or detailed logging is enabled.

## Objectives
- Record an audit trail for each command execution in batch or single command mode.
- Append a new field (auditTrail) to the response object containing an ordered list of audit entries.
- Each audit record should include the command string, a timestamp, the execution result (success or error), and the commandâ€™s executionTimeMS.
- Update verbose and diagnostics outputs to optionally display this audit information.
- Update documentation and tests to verify the new audit trail functionality is present and accurate.

## Implementation Details
- In the agenticHandler function, after each command is processed, create an audit entry containing: command, timestamp (using a consistent date-time format), execution result, and executionTimeMS.
- When the --verbose or --diagnostics flag is enabled, include the auditTrail field in the output JSON.
- Update the README to document the audit logging behavior and how it aids in debugging and performance evaluation.
- Ensure changes remain compatible with existing performance metrics and batch throttling functionality.
- Only modify the designated source file (main.js), related test files (tests/unit/main.test.js), the README file, and package.json if necessary.

## Testing and Verification
- Update unit tests to confirm that a valid auditTrail array is returned in verbose mode.
- Verify that each audit record contains a valid timestamp, the processed command, execution result, and executionTimeMS.
- Ensure that normal processing without verbose mode remains unchanged, while diagnostics reports include the audit information.
- Validate that the audit trail does not interfere with performance metrics or batch throttling behavior.

## Success Criteria
- The agenticHandler returns a response object with an auditTrail field when verbosity is enabled.
- Each audit entry accurately logs the details of the commands processed.
- README documentation is updated to explain the audit logging feature.
- All new and existing tests pass, ensuring both audit functionality and core features remain stable.
