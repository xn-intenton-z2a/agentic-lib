# Issue Reviewer

## Overview
The Issue Reviewer feature introduces an automated mechanism for evaluating whether a given source file content resolves a GitHub issue. By leveraging the OpenAI Chat Completions API through a dedicated function call (mirroring the existing review_issue function schema), this feature will assess the effectiveness of a code fix, validate issue resolution, and provide actionable refinement suggestions when necessary.

## Objective
- **Automated Code Review:** Automatically determine if a code change resolves the specified issue by analyzing provided source code content.
- **Actionable Feedback:** Return a structured response with clear indicators: a boolean string `fixed` ("true" or "false"), an explanatory `message`, and recommended `refinement` steps if the issue is unresolved.
- **Integration with Existing Workflows:** Seamlessly tie into existing features such as ISSUE_CREATOR and LLM_DELEGATOR to create a full cycle of issue creation, validation, and iterative improvement.
- **Enhanced Traceability:** Provide detailed logs and error handling to facilitate debugging and maintain traceability within automated agentic workflows.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **New Function Addition:**
   - Implement a library function, e.g., `reviewIssueWrapper(sourceCode, options)`, which wraps the OpenAI Chat Completions API call using the provided function schema.
   - Ensure the function accepts source code content and optional parameters to adjust model settings (e.g., temperature).

2. **Input Validation and Error Handling:**
   - Validate that the source code content is a non-empty string.
   - Employ robust error handling to manage and log potential API errors, JSON parsing issues, or schema mismatches.

3. **Schema Validation:**
   - Use zod (or a similar validation library) to enforce the response structure (`fixed`, `message`, `refinement`) as per the review_issue function schema.
   - Return a clear JSON object even in cases of validation failure.

4. **Testing and Integration:**
   - Develop comprehensive unit tests to cover various scenarios including valid resolutions, unresolved issues, and erroneous inputs.
   - Integrate the feature into the broader agentic-lib workflow, ensuring compatibility with automated issue creation and LLM delegation processes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The `reviewIssueWrapper` function successfully calls the OpenAI Chat Completions API with the correct function schema and parameters.
- On success, the function returns a valid response object with `fixed`, `message`, and `refinement` fields.
- In the event of errors, detailed logs are produced and a structured error response is returned.
- Relevant unit and integration tests pass, ensuring robust input validation and output consistency.
- The feature aligns with the mission of enabling autonomous workflows to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve code.
