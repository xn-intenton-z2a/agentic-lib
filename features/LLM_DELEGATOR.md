# Overview
This feature introduces a robust and enhanced LLM delegation layer within the agentic-lib. It is designed to encapsulate the complexities of invoking the OpenAI Chat Completions API, ensuring proper input validation, prompt auto-conversion, and detailed error handling while maintaining a consistent interface for downstream workflows.

# Objective
- **Enhanced LLM Invocation:** Provide a consistent wrapper (`delegateDecisionToLLMFunctionCallWrapper`) for communication with OpenAI's API, enabling autonomous decision-making in GitHub workflows.
- **Input Validation and Auto-Conversion:** Ensure all prompts are valid, auto-convert non-string inputs when enabled, and give clear messages if validation fails.
- **Error Transparency:** Capture and log detailed errors (e.g., missing API keys, invalid prompt types, parsing issues) to facilitate easier debugging and maintenance.

# Implementation Strategy
1. **Refinement of Input Handling:**
   - Enforce non-empty string prompts with detailed error messaging.
   - Optionally auto-convert prompts (number, boolean) to strings when the autoConvertPrompt flag is true.

2. **LLM API Integration Improvements:**
   - Use the OpenAI Chat Completions API with a well-defined function schema.
   - Integrate a dual approach to parsing results (from tool_calls results or direct content) to maximize reliability.

3. **Logging and Debugging Enhancements:**
   - Maintain structured logging for both successful and error cases for better traceability.
   - Ensure consistent logs that align with the main library's logging strategy.

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Expand unit tests to cover all edge cases of input types (e.g., empty, null, undefined, boolean, objects, and arrays) as well as successful API delegation scenarios.
   - Ensure that the feature aligns with current automated tests and CLI output requirements.

# Acceptance Criteria
- The LLM delegator correctly validates input prompts and performs auto conversion when enabled.
- It logs detailed information regarding API calls and associated errors.
- Existing tests pass without modifications and new tests (if added) cover all edge cases related to input validation and error handling.
- The feature seamlessly integrates with the existing mission of supporting autonomous workflows and future expansion in the agentic-lib.
