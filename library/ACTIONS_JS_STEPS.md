### Short answer
Yes — you can publish the JavaScript as an **npm / GitHub Packages** module and have the action code pull that package at runtime, even when the workflow that calls the action lives in the *same* repository.  
However you must arrange two extra things:

1. **A publish‑on‑commit (or on‑release) workflow** that pushes `@scope/agentic-lib` to the registry every time you cut a ref you want others to consume.
2. **A workflow step inside the action job** that runs `npm ci` (or `npm install`) so the runtime can actually resolve `require('@scope/agentic-lib')`.

Below is a practical recipe that builds on the GitHub Packages setup you already use in other workflows — see the `.npmrc` logic in *wfr‑completion‑generate‑feature‑development‑issue.yml* for reference citeturn0file4.

## 1  Publish the library on every commit you care about

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish-lib.yml   (in R1)
name: Publish agentic‑lib package

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]           # or 'release/*'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read           # to fetch the code
      packages: write          # to publish to GH Packages
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com
          cache: npm

      - run: npm ci

      # Optional: bump a prerelease like 0.1.0‑<shortSHA>
      - name: Compute version
        id: ver
        run: |
          echo "ver=$(node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').version.split('-')[0]+'-'+process.env.GITHUB_SHA.substr(0,7))")" >>"$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

      - run: npm version --no-git-tag-version ${{ steps.ver.outputs.ver }}

      - name: Publish
        run: npm publish --access public        # or omit --access for private
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That gives you **immutable** versions such as `0.4.2‑c0ffeee`.  
If you *also* want a moving “latest‑commit” tag you can add:

```bash
npm dist-tag add @org/agentic-lib@${{ steps.ver.outputs.ver }} latest-commit
```

## 2  Consume the package from inside the action job

Update your reusable workflow (or the calling workflow in **R2**) so the job that *runs* the action does an `npm ci` and has an `.npmrc` pointing at the same registry.  
You already do this pattern in other jobs citeturn0file4:

```yaml
jobs:
  find-pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm

      - name: Configure npm for GitHub Packages
        run: |
          echo "@xn-intenton-z2a:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com" >> .npmrc
          echo "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" >> .npmrc
          echo "always-auth=true"              >> .npmrc

      - run: npm ci            # pulls @xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib@latest‑commit

      - name: Find PR
        id: find-pr
        run: node -e "require('@xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib').findPrInCheckSuite()"
```

Your action entry file can now be as small as:

```js
// .github/actions/find-pr/action.yml
runs:
  using: 'node20'
  main: 'dist/index.js'       # compiled with esbuild/ncc
```

and `dist/index.js` might do nothing but:

```js
const { findPrInCheckSuite } = require('@xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib');
findPrInCheckSuite();
```

### Pros & Cons of the “pull‑from‑package” style

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|--------|---------|
| • Single source of truth for the logic (library).<br>• Consumers (R2, R3…) can choose **semver** or **commit‑tag** versions.<br>• Library can be reused outside Actions as well. | • Every job pays the cost of `npm ci`.<br>• Requires registry auth (`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`) in every repo that calls it.<br>• Less deterministic if you rely on a moving tag like `latest-commit`; better to pin to the immutable dist‑tag you publish. |

If startup speed and “works without `npm install`” matter, it’s still better to bundle the compiled JS **inside the action directory** and *optionally* share business logic through a package.

A common hybrid is:

1. **Library package** (`@org/agentic-lib-core`) – pure functions, published on commit.
2. **Action repo** – commits the compiled `dist/index.js` that `require`s the core lib, but *vendors* it (esbuild/ncc) so no install step is needed.  
   When you want to update the action, just bump the dependency and re‑compile in a release workflow.

That gives callers fast, dependency‑free actions **and** lets other Node projects depend on the same logic.
