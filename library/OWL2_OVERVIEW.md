Details:
1. Introduction: Defines OWL 2 for Semantic Web use, outlining document purpose and historical context.

2. Overview:
  2.1 Ontologies: OWL 2 Structural Specification defines ontology components using UML; functional-style syntax is provided for compact writing. Mapping to RDF Graphs enables bidirectional conversion between structural and RDF representations.
  2.2 Syntaxes: 
     - RDF/XML: Mandatory, based on Mapping to RDF Graphs, for tool interoperability.
     - OWL/XML: Optional XML serialization for easier XML tool integration.
     - Functional Syntax: Optional, emphasizes formal structural definition.
     - Manchester Syntax: Optional, optimized for readability in DL ontologies.
     - Turtle: Optional RDF serialization for triple-based representations.
  2.3 Semantics:
     - Direct Semantics: Specifies model theoretic semantics using SROIQ logic; enforces conditions like prohibition of transitive properties in number restrictions.
     - RDF-Based Semantics: Direct assignment of meaning to RDF graphs, compatible with RDF Semantics; supports OWL 2 Full.
     - Correspondence Theorem: Ensures inferences in OWL 2 DL under Direct Semantics hold when using RDF-Based Semantics.
  2.4 Profiles:
     - OWL 2 EL: Supports polynomial time reasoning for large ontologies.
     - OWL 2 QL: Facilitates lightweight ontologies with efficient relational query answering (AC0 complexity).
     - OWL 2 RL: Enables rule-based processing of RDF triples; sound reasoning with potential incompleteness.

3. Relationship to OWL 1: Maintains backward compatibility; all OWL 1 ontologies remain valid with identical inference behavior in most cases. Introduces enhancements such as qualified cardinality restrictions and richer datatype support.

4. Documentation Roadmap: Lists conceptual and technical documents including Structural Specification, Mapping to RDF Graphs, Direct and RDF-Based Semantics, Conformance tests, and user guides like Primer and Quick Reference Guide, with explicit document numbers and purposes.

## Supplementary Details
Technical Specifications:
- OWL 2 Structural Specification: Uses UML diagrams to define ontological elements (classes, properties, individuals) and supports a functional-style syntax for compact expression.
- Serialization Options:
  * RDF/XML: Mandatory; specification as per Mapping to RDF Graphs; exact role is to assure full interoperability among OWL 2 tools.
  * OWL/XML: Optional; XML-based with emphasis on ease in XML processing; referenced as 'OWL 2 XML'.
  * Functional Syntax: Optional; mirrors structural specification details.
  * Manchester Syntax: Optional; designed for human readability in DL style.
  * Turtle: Optional; provides alternative RDF triple syntax; not mandated by OWL-WG.
- Semantics Details:
  * Direct Semantics: Implements a model-theoretic semantics based on SROIQ. Key restrictions include: transitive properties cannot be used within number restrictions.
  * RDF-Based Semantics: Direct mapping to RDF graphs; fully compatible with standard RDF Semantics. Applicable to any ontology, enabling use in OWL 2 Full environments.
  * Correspondence Theorem: Provides assurance that inferences made under Direct Semantics persist when ontologies are converted to RDF graphs.
- Profiles:
  * OWL 2 EL: Suitable for applications demanding efficient, polynomial time reasoning over large ontologies.
  * OWL 2 QL: Tailored for conjunctive query answering with relational database integration; target complexity is LogSpace or AC0.
  * OWL 2 RL: Rule-based reasoning on RDF triples, with implementations ensuring soundness even if completeness is not guaranteed.

## Reference Details
API & Specification Details:
- Function: MappingToRDFGraphs(ontology: OWL2Ontology) -> RDFGraph; Ensures bidirectional mapping based on OWL 2 Structural Specifications.
- Function: ValidateOntology(ontology: OWL2Ontology, semantics: 'Direct'|'RDF-Based') -> ValidationResult; Checks for SROIQ compliance (Direct Semantics) and for RDF consistency (RDF-Based Semantics).
- Code Example (Pseudo-code):
  /* Using Functional Syntax for OWL 2 DL Ontology */
  ontology = new OWL2Ontology();
  ontology.addClass('Person');
  ontology.addProperty('hasAge', { domain: 'Person', range: 'Integer' });
  if (ValidateOntology(ontology, 'Direct').isValid) {
      rdfGraph = MappingToRDFGraphs(ontology);
      // Proceed with reasoning
  } else {
      // Handle validation errors: e.g., transitive property used in number restrictions
  }
- Configuration Options:
  * UseRDFXML: true (default) - Ensures all tools support RDF/XML serialization.
  * UseOWLXML: false (default) - Option to enable alternate XML serialization.
  * ReasoningMode: 'Direct' or 'RDF-Based' with expected input: ontology object; output: inference result set based on SROIQ compliance.
- Best Practices:
  * Always validate ontology against OWL 2 Structural constraints before exporting.
  * Use Manchester Syntax for manual editing to enhance readability.
  * For large data sets, prefer OWL 2 EL profile to guarantee polynomial time reasoning.
- Troubleshooting Procedures:
  * Command: owl2-validator --input ontology.owl --mode Direct
    Expected Output: Confirmation of valid ontology or error codes indicating misuse of transitive properties.
  * Command: rdf-mapper --input ontology.owl --output ontology.rdf
    Expected Output: RDF graph with complete mapping details.
  * Check logs for specific warnings on non-compliance with OWL 2 DL restrictions.

SDK Method Signatures (illustrative):
- OWL2Ontology.addClass(name: string): void
- OWL2Ontology.addProperty(name: string, options: {domain: string, range: string, characteristics?: string[]}): void
- OWL2Reasoner.computeInferences(ontology: OWL2Ontology, mode: 'Direct'|'RDF-Based'): InferenceResult

Return Types:
- ValidationResult: { isValid: boolean, errors: string[] }
- InferenceResult: { inferredClasses: string[], inferredProperties: string[] }

## Overview Content
The document serves as an introduction to OWL 2, detailing its syntax, semantics, profiles and relationship to OWL 1. It explains the structure of OWL 2 ontologies, the mapping to RDF graphs and provides both direct and RDF-based semantics with a correspondence theorem.

### 2. Overview
- Describes the constituents of OWL 2 including classes, properties, individuals, and datatypes.

### 2.1 Ontologies
- Defined by the OWL 2 Structural Specification.
- Uses UML to represent structural elements and introduces the functional-style syntax.
- Specifies that any OWL 2 ontology can be viewed as an RDF graph as per the Mapping to RDF Graphs document.

### 2.2 Syntaxes
- Primary syntax: RDF/XML (Mandatory) for interchange among OWL 2 tools.
- Alternative syntaxes include:
  - OWL/XML: XML Serialization (Optional, easier XML processing)
  - Functional Syntax: Emphasizes formal structure (Optional)
  - Manchester Syntax: User-friendly DL syntax (Optional)
  - Turtle: Alternative RDF serialization (Optional, not from OWL-WG)

### 2.3 Semantics
- Two semantics provided:
  - Direct Semantics: Based on SROIQ description logic, supports OWL 2 DL with restrictions (e.g., transitive property restrictions).
  - RDF-Based Semantics: Assigns meaning directly to RDF graphs and is fully compatible with RDF Semantics, applicable to any OWL 2 ontology (OWL 2 Full).
- Includes a correspondence theorem linking the two semantics for OWL 2 DL ontologies.

### 2.4 Profiles
- OWL 2 Profiles are subsets of OWL 2 with advantages for specific applications.
  - OWL 2 EL: Enables polynomial time reasoning for large ontologies.
  - OWL 2 QL: Supports conjunctive queries using relational databases (LogSpace/AC0).
  - OWL 2 RL: Implements polynomial time reasoning using rule-based systems on RDF triples; may sacrifice completeness in some cases.

### 3. Relationship to OWL 1
- Highlights backward compatibility where OWL 1 ontologies remain valid OWL 2 ontologies.
- New features in OWL 2 include richer datatypes, qualified cardinality restrictions, and enhanced annotation capabilities, among others.

### 4. Documentation Roadmap
- Lists core specification documents outlining:
  - Structural Specification and Functional-Style Syntax
  - Mapping to RDF Graphs
  - Direct Semantics and RDF-Based Semantics
  - Conformance tests
  - Additional user documents (Primer, New Features and Rationale, Quick Reference Guide)
