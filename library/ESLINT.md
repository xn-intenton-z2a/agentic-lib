Table of Contents: Prerequisites, Quick Start, Configuration, Global Install, Manual Set Up, Next Steps. 

Prerequisites: Requires Node.js (versions ^18.18.0, ^20.9.0, or >=21.1.0) with SSL. 

Quick Start: Provides commands using npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun to initialize configuration with `npm init @eslint/config@latest`. 

Configuration: Covering dynamic question-based setup, sample code for eslint.config.js, and rule definitions. 

Global Install: Advises against global installation due to potential dependency mismanagement. 

Manual Set Up: Details creating a package.json, installing ESLint locally, and setting up configuration files manually. 

Next Steps: Encourages further learning on advanced configurations and custom rule creation.

## Supplementary Details
Recent updates in ESLint include improved performance and additional rules. Integration with modern CI/CD pipelines and IDEs is enhanced. Companies widely use ESLint to maintain code quality, and its community continues to contribute plugins and custom configurations.

## Reference Details
The document provides API-like specification details including method invocations such as `npm init @eslint/config@latest`, configuration patterns using ECMAScript module imports (e.g., `import { defineConfig } from "eslint/config";`), and sample rule configurations ('no-unused-vars': 'warn', 'no-undef': 'warn'). It covers multiple code blocks for different package managers and explains error levels (off/0, warn/1, error/2) for fine-grained rule control. The provided examples detail how to extend ESLint using shareable configurations, configure globals for browser environments, and use CLI commands (`npx eslint yourfile.js`). These technical details serve as best practices and troubleshooting guides for developers integrating ESLint in their projects.
