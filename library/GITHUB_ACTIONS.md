jobs:
  <job_id>:
    runs-on: <runner_label>              # String: e.g., ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest or custom labels for self-hosted
    steps:
      - run: "<shell_command>"         # Executes a shell command
      - name: <step_name>                # Optional step name
        uses: <action>@<version>         # Reusable GitHub Action (e.g., actions/checkout@v4)
        with:
          <parameter>: <value>           # Action input parameters
      - run: |
          <multi_line_script>           # Multi-line shell script
```

--- Example Code ---

# Checkout Code Example:
```
- name: Check out repository code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

# Caching Dependencies Example:
```
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  env:
    cache-name: cache-node-modules
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-
```

# Matrix Build Example:
```
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```

--- Advanced Configuration ---

1. Secrets Usage:
   - Define secrets in repository settings.
   - Access in workflow: `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`

2. Event Triggering and Environment Variables:
   - Trigger on push: 
     ```yaml
     on:
       push:
         branches: [ 'main', 'releases/**' ]
     ```
   - Automatic setting of GITHUB_SHA, GITHUB_REF, etc.

3. Best Practices:
   - Use YAML linters (e.g., yamllint) to validate configuration
   - Use conditional expressions (if: success(), if: failure()) to handle step logic
   - Clearly specify runner environments to ensure determinism

4. Troubleshooting Procedures:
   - Access detailed logs in the GitHub Actions UI
   - Run debug commands such as:
     ```yaml
     - run: echo "Debug Info: ${{ github.ref }}"
     ```
   - Validate cached keys and restore through proper key formatting

## Workflows

Workflows are defined in YAML and stored in the `.github/workflows` directory. Each workflow file must have a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension. A workflow consists of events that trigger it, jobs to execute tasks, and steps within each job.

### YAML Workflow Example

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

## Events

Workflows are triggered by events. Supported events include:
- `push`
- `fork`
- `release`
- Scheduled events (via cron syntax)
- Manual triggers (via repository dispatch)

Each workflow run uses environment variables such as `GITHUB_SHA` and `GITHUB_REF` to indicate the commit and branch associated with the event.

## Jobs and Steps

- **Jobs:** Collections of steps that run on a specified runner. Jobs can run sequentially (using the `needs` keyword) or in parallel by default.
- **Steps:** Individual commands or actions executed within a job. This can include shell commands (using `run`) or reusable actions (using `uses`).

## Workflow Templates

GitHub offers preconfigured workflow templates for Continuous Integration (CI), deployment, automation, and more. These templates can be modified to suit project-specific requirements.

## Advanced Features and Configurations

- **Secrets Management:** Use secrets (e.g., `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`) to handle sensitive data without hardcoding it.
- **Caching Dependencies:** Use actions like `actions/cache@v4` to cache dependencies. Example:

  ```yaml
  - name: Cache node modules
    uses: actions/cache@v4
    env:
      cache-name: cache-node-modules
    with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-
  ```

- **Matrix Builds:** Automatically create multiple job instances with different configurations. Example:

  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      strategy:
        matrix:
          node: [14, 16]
      steps:
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
          with:
            node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
  ```

- **Runners:** Specify the execution environment with `runs-on`. Options include GitHub-hosted runners (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`) and self-hosted runners (using custom labels).

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- **Logs and Diagnostics:** Check job logs in the Actions UI for detailed step execution information.
- **YAML Validation:** Use tools like `yamllint` to ensure correct YAML syntax.
- **Conditional Execution:** Control step or job execution using conditionals (e.g., `if: success()` or `if: failure()`).
