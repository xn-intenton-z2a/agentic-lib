### 1. Workflows and YAML Basics
**Example:**
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Triggered by ${{ github.event_name }} event"
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### 2. Event Triggers
Define events with the `on` key. For example:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
```

### 3. Job Configuration
Jobs are collections of steps. For dependent execution use the `needs` keyword:
```yaml
jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./setup.sh
  build:
    needs: setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./build.sh
```

### 4. Matrix Strategy
Define multiple runs with varying parameters:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [12, 14, 16]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```

### 5. Caching Dependencies
Cache directories to speed up workflows:
```yaml
- name: Cache npm modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

### 6. Using Secrets and Environment Variables
Inject secrets securely:
```yaml
- name: Use Secret
  env:
    API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
  run: echo "API key is set"
```

### 7. Service Containers
Configure ephemeral service containers:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: node:20
    services:
      redis:
        image: redis
    steps:
      - run: npm test
```

### 8. Runner Selection
Specify runner labels to control execution environment:
```yaml
jobs:
  custom-runner:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running on a custom runner"
```

### 9. Advanced Troubleshooting
- **Viewing Logs:** Use the GitHub Actions UI to expand step logs.
- **Re-running Workflows:** Use the Re-run button in the Actions tab.
- **Canceling Workflows:** Use the cancel workflow option in the UI.
- **Avoiding Recursive Triggers:** Use appropriate tokens (e.g., use a personal access token if triggering a workflow from another workflow).


## Supplementary Details
### Technical Specifications and Implementation Details

- **Workflow File Location:** All workflow YAML files must reside in the `.github/workflows` directory.
- **Mandatory YAML Keys:** `name`, `on`, `jobs`. Optionally, `run-name` can be used for custom naming per run.
- **Event Triggers:** Define events (e.g., push, pull_request). Use filters for branches and activity types as needed.
- **Job Dependencies:** Use `needs` to enforce job sequencing. Jobs without dependencies run in parallel.
- **Matrix Configuration:** Use the `strategy.matrix` section to run jobs with variable combinations; example: Node.js versions [14, 16].
- **Caching:** Use `actions/cache@v4` with explicit keys based on runner OS and dependency file hashes.
- **Secrets Management:** Secrets are referenced using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` and injected as environment variables.
- **Service Containers:** Define containers under the `container` key and use the `services` key to start related service containers (e.g., postgres, redis).
- **Runner Constraints:** Specify exact runner labels in `runs-on` to target specific hardware or hosted environments.
- **Best Practices:** Always name steps, use comments for clarity, and ensure your YAML configuration is correctly indented. Use the GitHub Actions UI to view logs and troubleshoot errors.


## Reference Details
### API Specifications and Complete Code Examples

#### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow YAML Specification

- **name:** (string) The display name for the workflow.
- **run-name:** (string) Custom name injected per run using GitHub expressions.
- **on:** (array/object) Specifies the events that trigger the workflow. Examples:
  - `push`: Can include branch filters.
  - `pull_request`: Can specify activity types like opened, synchronized.
  - `workflow_dispatch`: Allows manual triggering with inputs.

- **jobs:** (object) A dictionary of job definitions. Each job includes:
  - **runs-on:** (string or array) The runner environment (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `[self-hosted, linux, x64]`).
  - **strategy:** (object, optional) For matrix builds. Contains `matrix` property with parameter array.
  - **steps:** (array) A list of step definitions. Each step can be:
    - **run:** (string) A command line to execute.
    - **uses:** (string) Reference to a GitHub Action (with version tag, e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`).
    - **env:** (object, optional) Environment variables mapping.

**Example Full Workflow:**
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ Triggered by ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß Running on ${{ runner.os }}."
      - run: echo "Branch: ${{ github.ref }}, Repository: ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "Repository cloned to runner."
      - name: List files
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "Job status: ${{ job.status }}."
```

#### 2. SDK Method Signatures and Usage in Actions (Conceptual)

While GitHub Actions does not expose a traditional SDK API, actions are defined via YAML and executable code. For instance, an action written in JavaScript might export a function:

```javascript
const core = require('@actions/core');

function run() {
  try {
    const message = core.getInput('message', { required: true });
    console.log(`Message: ${message}`);
    core.setOutput('success', 'true');
  } catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run();
```

**Parameters:**
- `getInput(name: string, options?: { required: boolean }): string`
- `setOutput(name: string, value: string): void`
- `setFailed(message: string): void`

#### 3. Troubleshooting Procedures

- **Viewing Logs:** Use the GitHub Actions UI to inspect detailed logs for each step.
- **Re-run Workflow:** Click the "Re-run jobs" button in the Actions tab after a failure.
- **Cancel Workflow:** Use the "Cancel workflow" option if a job hangs.
- **Command-line Testing:** Locally test shell commands using the same environment variables, e.g.,
  ```bash
  echo "Testing GitHub Actions environment: $GITHUB_WORKSPACE"
  ls $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
  ```
- **Cache Verification:** Check cache key output for `actions/cache@v4` and verify file paths.

#### 4. Configuration Options and Their Effects

- **`runs-on`:** Specifies the OS; affects available pre-installed software.
- **`key` in cache:** Must be unique per OS and dependency state; affects cache hit rate.
- **`matrix` options:** Produce parallel jobs; ensure tests do not conflict.
- **Secrets configuration:** Must be set in repository settings; accessed via `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`.

Follow these detailed specifications to implement and troubleshoot GitHub Actions workflows effectively.

## Digest of GITHUB_ACTIONS

# GitHub Actions Documentation

**Retrieved on:** 2023-10-12

## Overview
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates build, test, and deployment pipelines. Workflows are defined in YAML files stored under the `.github/workflows` directory in a repository.

## Workflow Structure
- **Workflow**: A configurable automated process defined in YAML with one or more jobs.
- **Events**: Trigger conditions such as `push`, `pull_request`, `repository_dispatch`, or scheduled events.
- **Jobs**: A collection of steps that run on a single runner. Jobs can run sequentially (using dependencies) or in parallel.
- **Steps**: Individual commands or actions executed within a job. Steps may run shell scripts or call pre-built actions.

## Key YAML Syntax Elements

### Basic Workflow YAML Example
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

### Event Triggers
Workflows can be triggered by:
- **Repository events**: `push`, `pull_request`, `issues` etc.
- **Scheduled triggers**: Using cron syntax
- **Manual triggers**: `workflow_dispatch`

### Defining Jobs and Dependencies
Jobs are defined under the `jobs` key. Dependencies can be modeled using the `needs` keyword:
```yaml
jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./setup_server.sh

  build:
    needs: setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./build_server.sh

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./test_server.sh
```

### Matrix Strategy
To run tests against different versions or configurations:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```

### Caching Dependencies
Example for caching npm modules:
```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  env:
    cache-name: cache-node-modules
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-
```

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Using Secrets
Secrets can be injected into workflows:
```yaml
- name: Retrieve secret
  env:
    super_secret: ${{ secrets.SUPERSECRET }}
  run: |
    echo "Using secret: $super_secret"
```

### Service Containers
To run a job within a containerized service environment:
```yaml
jobs:
  container-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: node:20-bookworm-slim
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - name: Connect to PostgreSQL
        run: node client.js
        env:
          POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
          POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
```

### Runner Selection via Labels
Specify runners using labels:
```yaml
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, gpu]
```

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- **Monitoring Workflow Runs**: Navigate to the Actions tab in the repository to view logs and job details.
- **Re-running or Cancelling Workflows**: Use the GitHub UI to manage active or failed workflow runs.
- **Avoid Recursive Triggers**: Use tokens correctly (e.g., avoid using GITHUB_TOKEN when triggering another workflow from within a workflow run).
- **Efficient Caching**: Keep cache keys updated using hash functions on dependency lock files.
