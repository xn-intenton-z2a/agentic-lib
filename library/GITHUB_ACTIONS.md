### 1. Overview
GitHub Actions automates CI/CD pipelines. The workflows are YAML files placed in the `.github/workflows` directory.

### 2. Workflow Configuration
- **YAML File Placement:** `.github/workflows`
- **Key Elements:** `name`, `on`, `jobs`.
- **YAML Example:**
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
  ExampleJob:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Triggered by ${{ github.event_name }}"
```

### 3. Event Triggers
- **Definition:** Events that trigger workflows (e.g., push, pull_request, schedule).
- **Syntax Example:**
```yaml
on: [push, pull_request]
```

### 4. Job and Step Definitions
- **Jobs:** Consist of multiple steps running on a designated runner.
- **Example of Dependent Jobs:**
```yaml
jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./setup.sh
  build:
    needs: setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./build.sh
```

### 5. Actions and Runners
- **Actions Usage:** Reusable tasks, e.g., checking out code using `actions/checkout@v4`.
- **Runners:** Specified via `runs-on` (e.g., ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest).

### 6. Advanced Configurations
#### 6.1 Matrix Strategy
- **Purpose:** Run jobs across different configurations.
- **Example:**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [14, 16]
```

#### 6.2 Caching Dependencies
- **Purpose:** Cache directories like `~/.npm` to speed up workflows.
- **Example:**
```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

#### 6.3 Service Containers
- **Purpose:** Provide ephemeral service containers (e.g., PostgreSQL) during workflows.
- **Example:**
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
```

### 7. Quickstart Workflow Example
A complete workflow that clones the repository, lists files, and reports status:
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Triggered by ${{ github.event_name }}"
      - run: echo "Running on ${{ runner.os }}"
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: List files
        run: ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "Job status: ${{ job.status }}"
```


## Supplementary Details
### Detailed Implementation Specifications

1. **Workflow File Structure**:
   - Must be located in `.github/workflows/`.
   - Filename must end with `.yml` or `.yaml`.
   - Example structure:
     - `.github/`
       - `workflows/`
         - `github-actions-demo.yml`

2. **Key YAML Keys and Their Effects**:
   - `name`: Display name of the workflow.
   - `run-name`: Custom label for each run, interpolating variables (e.g., `${{ github.actor }}`).
   - `on`: Defines when the workflow is executed. Can be events like `push`, `pull_request` or a schedule.
   - `jobs`: Collection of job definitions.
   - `runs-on`: Specifies the OS image. Common values: `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`.
   - `steps`: Ordered list of commands or actions.

3. **Matrix Strategy & Caching Examples**:
   - **Matrix Usage:** Trial different Node.js versions:
     ```yaml
     strategy:
       matrix:
         node: [14, 16]
     ```
   - **Cache Dependencies:** Caching NPM modules to optimize subsequent runs:
     ```yaml
     - uses: actions/cache@v4
       with:
         path: ~/.npm
         key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
     ```

4. **Service Container Configuration:**
   - Runs a container for PostgreSQL:
     ```yaml
     services:
       postgres:
         image: postgres
         ports:
           - 5432:5432
     ```
   - Integration: Environment variables (e.g., `POSTGRES_HOST`) must match the service name.

5. **Secrets and Security Best Practices:**
   - Use GitHub Secrets to secure sensitive data:
     ```yaml
     env:
       SUPER_SECRET: ${{ secrets.SUPERSECRET }}
     ```
   - Do not hardcode credentials in workflows.

6. **Troubleshooting Procedures:**
   - **Viewing Logs:** Navigate to the Actions tab, select a run, and expand steps for detailed logs.
   - **Common Command:**
     ```bash
     ls ${{ github.workspace }}
     ```
     Use this command to verify workspace contents.
   - **Error Investigation:**
     - Check if the workflow file is in the correct directory.
     - Ensure correct indentation in YAML files.
     - Validate runner selection and environment variable usage.

7. **Step-by-Step Workflow Execution:**
   - Commit a YAML file to trigger a workflow run.
   - Monitor execution via the GitHub Actions logs interface.
   - Re-run failed jobs using the GitHub web UI or CLI commands.


## Reference Details
### Complete API Specifications & SDK Method Signatures

#### Workflow YAML API Specification

- **Workflow Definition File**:
  - File path: `.github/workflows/<filename>.yml`
  - Mandatory keys: `name`, `on`, `jobs`

- **Job Definition**:
  - Key: `runs-on`: Accepts string or array of strings (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `[self-hosted, linux, x64, gpu]`).
  - Key: `steps`: Array of step definitions.
  - Each step can include:
    - `run`: string command to execute.
    - `uses`: action reference in the format `owner/name@version`.
    - `name`: descriptive label for the step.
    - `env`: dictionary of environment variables (key: variable name, value: interpolated string).

#### Example SDK/CLI Command and Method Signatures

Although GitHub Actions does not use traditional SDK method signatures, the following structure is directly usable in workflows:

```yaml
# Example: Checkout and Cache
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16]
    steps:
      # Check out the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Setup Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

      # Cache node modules
      - name: Cache modules
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      # Build the project
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```

#### Detailed Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Workflow Directory Structure**:
   - Command:
     ```bash
     find . -type d -name '.github'
     ```
   - Expected Output: Directory structure including `/workflows`.

2. **Validate YAML File**:
   - Use online YAML linters or the GitHub Actions built-in validator.
   - Ensure proper indentation (2 spaces recommended) and valid syntax.

3. **Examine Runner Logs**:
   - Navigate to the Actions tab on the repository page.
   - Click on the failed run, select the job and expand steps to see error details.
   - Look for command outputs such as `ls ${{ github.workspace }}` to ensure files exist.

4. **Common Configuration Options and Their Effects**:
   - `runs-on`: Determines which OS image is used. Incorrect values may result in runner selection errors.
   - `on`: Incorrect or overly broad event filters might trigger unwanted runs. Use specific branch filters if needed.
   - `env`: Must be defined with available secrets; missing secrets will cause runtime failures.

5. **Best Practices Implementation Example**:
   - Split workflows by purpose (CI, CD, testing) to isolate failures.
   - Use caching and matrix strategies to improve performance and coverage.
   - Incorporate error checking in scripts, e.g., exit codes in shell commands.

Developers can copy the YAML examples provided directly into their repository to set up a fully operational GitHub Actions workflow without additional modifications.

## Overview
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates build, test, and deployment workflows directly in your repositories. It supports triggering workflows across Linux, Windows, and macOS runners, or via self-hosted runners. Workflows are defined using YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory.

## Core Components

### Workflows
- **Definition:** A configurable automated process defined in YAML.
- **Location:** `.github/workflows` directory.
- **Usage:** Can contain one or more jobs that are triggered by repository events, schedules, manual triggers, or via API.
- **Example YAML Snippet:**

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The branch is ${{ github.ref }} in repository ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° Repository cloned."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè Job status: ${{ job.status }}."
```

### Events
- **Trigger Types:** push, pull_request, schedule, repository_dispatch, manual triggers, etc.
- **Configuration:** Defined using the `on:` key in the workflow YAML.

### Jobs and Steps
- **Jobs:** Series of steps executed on the same runner. They can run sequentially (using the `needs` keyword) or in parallel.
- **Steps:** Commands run as shell scripts or actions. Include direct commands and usage of pre-built actions.

### Actions
- **Definition:** Reusable extensions that perform specific tasks (e.g., checkout code, set up environments).
- **Usage Example:** ```uses: actions/checkout@v4```

### Runners
- **Available Runners:** Ubuntu, Windows, macOS (hosted by GitHub) and self-hosted options.
- **Configuration:** Specified using `runs-on` (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).

## Advanced Configurations

### Matrix Strategy
- **Purpose:** Run tests on multiple configurations using a single job definition.
- **Example:**

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```

### Caching Dependencies
- **Purpose:** Improve performance by caching dependency directories.
- **Example:**

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-
```

### Service Containers
- **Usage:** Spin up ephemeral containers for services (e.g., PostgreSQL) during a job.
- **Example:**

```yaml
jobs:
  container-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: node:20-bookworm-slim
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - name: Connect to PostgreSQL
        run: node client.js
        env:
          POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
          POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
```
