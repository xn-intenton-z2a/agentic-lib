# GITHUB_ACTIONS

## Crawl Summary
GitHub Actions enables CI/CD workflows defined via YAML in .github/workflows. Key components include workflows that trigger on repository events, jobs executed on hosted or self-hosted runners, and reusable actions (e.g., actions/checkout@v4). Configurations support event filters, dependency management with 'needs', matrix builds, caching, and secrets integration. Detailed quickstart YAML examples provide immediate implementation instructions.

Detailed Technical Information:
- Workflows: Must reside in .github/workflows with a .yml/.yaml extension. Example keys include 'name', 'on', and 'jobs'.
- Events: Declare triggers with on: push, on: [push, fork] or detailed event structure with types.
- Jobs: Each job specifies 'runs-on' (e.g., ubuntu-latest), contains a sequence of steps, and supports dependencies via 'needs'.
- Actions: Example usage 'actions/checkout@v4'; specify with 'uses' key.
- Runners: Environment variables such as runner.os, github.actor, github.event_name are available for dynamic configuration.
- Advanced: Matrix build example uses strategy: matrix: { node: [14, 16] }. Caching uses a key format with runner.os and hashFiles. Secrets are referenced as ${{ secrets.SUPERSECRET }} in job steps.

- Example Code Implementation (YAML):
  name: GitHub Actions Demo
  run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    Explore-GitHub-Actions:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
        - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
        - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
        - name: Check out repository code
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
        - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
        - name: List files in the repository
          run: |
            ls ${{ github.workspace }}
        - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."

Best Practices:
- Place workflow files in .github/workflows with proper YAML formatting.
- Use secrets to manage sensitive information; do not hard-code credentials.
- Use matrix strategies to test code across multiple environments.
- Define job dependencies with the 'needs' keyword to control execution order.
- Monitor job logs via the GitHub Actions UI and use echo commands for debugging.

Troubleshooting Procedures:
1. Verify YAML syntax with an online linter or GitHub Actions validation.
2. Check the Actions tab for log output; identify failing steps by expanding log sections.
3. Use commands like 'ls ${{ github.workspace }}' to inspect file system state.
4. Confirm that environment variables such as ${{ github.actor }} are correctly populated.
5. Review secret configuration in the repository settings to ensure accessibility.

## Overview
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows automated build, test, and deployment workflows directly in a GitHub repository. Workflows are defined in YAML files located in the .github/workflows directory and are triggered by repository events, schedules, or manual dispatch.

## Workflows
- Definition: A workflow is a YAML-configured automated process comprising one or more jobs.
- Location: .github/workflows/*.yml or .yaml
- Trigger: Workflows run on events such as push, pull request, release, etc.
- Example YAML snippet:

  name: GitHub Actions Demo
  run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    Explore-GitHub-Actions:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
        - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
        - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
        - name: Check out repository code
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
        - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
        - name: List files in the repository
          run: |
            ls ${{ github.workspace }}
        - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."

## Events
- Definition: Events trigger workflow runs. They include push, fork, issues, repository_dispatch, schedule, and manual triggers.
- Event configuration: Defined using the 'on' key in the YAML file, e.g. on: [push]
- Advanced: Use activity types and filters to fine-tune triggering (e.g., label event with type: created).

## Jobs
- A job is a sequence of steps that runs on a designated runner.
- Jobs can run in parallel or be sequentially dependent (using the 'needs' keyword).
- Example dependency setup:

  jobs:
    setup:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - run: ./setup_server.sh
    build:
      needs: setup
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - run: ./build_server.sh
    test:
      needs: build
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - run: ./test_server.sh

## Actions
- Definition: Custom or community-developed tasks that can be reused across workflows.
- Example usage: 'actions/checkout@v4' is used to clone the repository into the runner.

## Runners
- GitHub provides hosted runners (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) or self-hosted runners.
- Each job runs on a fresh VM or container instance with environment variables like runner.os and github.ref available.

## Advanced Features
- Secrets: Store sensitive data using ${{ secrets.NAME }} and use in workflows.
- Matrix strategies: Run jobs with multiple configurations. Example:

  strategy:
    matrix:
      node: [14, 16]

- Caching: Use actions/cache@v4 to cache dependencies, e.g., npm modules.
- Service containers: Define services (like postgres) inside a job using the 'services' key.

## Troubleshooting
- View logs via the Actions tab in GitHub.
- Check command outputs using echo statements and ls commands.
- Example: Check file listing with ls ${{ github.workspace }}; job status with echo ${{ job.status }}.
