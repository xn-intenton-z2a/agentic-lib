Introduction: AWS Lambda is designed for scalable, serverless computing. Developers only supply code while AWS manages resource provisioning, scaling, and maintenance.

When to Use Lambda: Ideal for file/stream processing, web application backends, and IoT or mobile applications, Lambda scales automatically based on demand.

Key Features: Features include environment variables for configuration, function versions for stable deployments, container image support for complex workloads, and concurrency controls for optimal performance.

Environment Variables: They allow runtime configuration without code changes. Configuration can be managed via console, AWS CLI, or SDKs, with best practices ensuring security.

Function Versioning & Container Images: Versioning locks configuration for stable iterations while container images provide flexibility for custom runtimes and dependencies.

## Supplementary Details
Recent updates to AWS Lambda include support for AL2023-based images for a smaller deployment footprint, enhanced security features for environment variables through AWS Secrets Manager, and improvements in runtime performance with Lambda SnapStart. These additions further empower developers to build efficient and secure serverless applications.

## Reference Details
API Specifications and Configuration Options:
- API operations: update-function-configuration, get-function-configuration, publish-version are detailed for managing function settings and versioning.
- CLI Examples: 
  • Setting environment variables using AWS CLI: aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name my-function --environment "Variables={BUCKET=amzn-s3-demo-bucket,KEY=file.txt}"
  • Retrieving configuration via: aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name my-function
- Code Examples:
  • Python code snippet for log level configuration using os.environ
  • Node.js sample utilizing winston for logging with dynamic log levels
- Best Practices: Use environment variables securely (prefer AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data), lock configurations via function versions, and leverage container image strategies (AWS base images, OS-only or non-AWS images) to optimize deployment.
- Implementation Patterns: Guidance on using the Lambda runtime API for custom runtimes, including incorporating runtime interface clients for languages lacking AWS-provided images.
