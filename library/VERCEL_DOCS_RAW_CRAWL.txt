Vercel builds tools to help you create products faster.
Like v0, which is your web development assistant. Paste a screenshot or write a few sentences and v0 will generate a starting point for your next app, including the code for how it looks and how it works. v0 then connects to Vercel, takes your code, and creates a URL you can share.

Iterate quickly while building your product
The first version of your product isn't perfect, so you need to iterate and try things.
You can ask v0 to make updates for you, or if you prefer, export the code to your editor and start building locally. When you've finished adding your new feature, you want to test and make sure it works correctly on different browsers and devices before you update your live application.
Vercel integrates with tools like GitHub where you can save snapshots of your codebase for every change. For example, let's say you send your latest code changes to GitHub in a pull request. Vercel automatically creates a new URL from your changes and sends you a link to review before merging.
Infrastructure from your code
How did that URL get created? Vercel took care of all the infrastructure automation for you:

It examined your code to understand what tools you're working with
It installed the necessary dependencies into a temporary, secure sandbox
It ran compute to build your application from these dependencies
It took the build output and generated the cloud infrastructure needed to run your app
It assigned and secured a domain so you can access your app through a URL

This is all happening inside of an automatically generated preview environment on Vercel — a place where you can safely iterate and make changes without affecting your application. For example, you might want to connect to a different database to prevent changing your live data.
If your application works correctly and you're happy with the changes, you can merge this new feature into your main codebase. Once again, Vercel will automatically create and build a new URL for you, in a separate production environment.
Just like that, your application is now live and updated around the world. Make a mistake? Don't sweat it — you can instantly go back to your previous version in a few clicks.
Use your favorite developer tools
Vercel helps your build any way your prefer, whether that is a handful of HTML files or a powerful JavaScript framework. While you don't need to use a framework, these abstractions can help you build better products.
Frameworks include components and optimizations to help improve your Core Web Vitals, which is how search engines determine the speed and quality of your application. Your vitals affect your page ranking in search results, so it's important to pay attention and optimize them.
Frameworks also simplify how you build common patterns, like routing between pages or fetching and displaying data from a database. Vercel supports over 30 different frameworks with zero-configuration.
We are the creators and maintainers of Next.js, a framework for building React applications. We also help fund the full-time development of Svelte, as well as support other open-source frameworks.

Stay fast and secure
Vercel's developer platform understands the tools and frameworks you're using. This enables us to optimize and secure your application automatically in ways that are normally difficult and time consuming.
Instead of manually writing code to define your application infrastructure, Vercel can automatically convert the output from your framework into infrastructure. For example, we manage:

Networking: We help make your application fast globally
Domains: We can manage your domains, including DNS, SSL certificates, and nameservers
Storage: We offer cache and object storage, as well as first-party database integrations
Compute: We provide an autoscaling, distributed, and secure compute platform
CI/CD: We automatically deploy your application as you push to your git repository

Observability
After shipping your application, you need to understand how it's performing in production. Vercel includes tools to help you view logs and traces, measure performance, and analyze traffic.

Logging: We allow you to view, search, and filter build/runtime logs to investigate issues and monitor your application.
Tracing: We support integrations with tracing tools like OpenTelemetry for deeper performance analysis.
Analytics: We support first-party, privacy-friendly analytics for understanding how users interact with your application.
Metrics: We display and support querying of performance metrics like request counts, error rates, and API latencies.

We also integrate with other observability tools and support draining logs to any service.
Security
Vercel helps protect your web application and prevent unwanted traffic.

Platform Firewall: We automatically block malicious requests and unwanted bots before they reach your application.
DDoS Protection: We protect your application from traffic spikes caused by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
Web Application Firewall: We allow you to define custom rules to protect from common attacks, web scrapers, and other unwanted traffic.

We are compliant with SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001:2013, GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and other acronyms your security team asks about.

Boost productivity and scale effortlessly.To get started with Vercel, it's helpful to understand projects and deployments:

Projects: A project is the application that you have deployed to Vercel. You can have multiple projects connected to a single repository (for example, a monorepo), and multiple deployments for each project. You can view all your projects on the dashboard, and configure your settings through the project dashboard.
Deployments: A deployment is the result of a successful build of your project. A deployment is triggered when you import an existing project or template, or when you push a Git commit through your connected integration or use vercel deploy from the CLI. Every deployment generates a URL automatically.

Next steps
To get started you’ll create a new project by either deploying a template or importing and deploying an existing project:

Accelerate your development on Vercel with Templates. This guide will show you how to use templates to fast-track project setup, leverage popular frontend frameworks, and maximize Vercel's features.
Find a templateFrom https://vercel.com/templates, select the template you’d like to deploy. You can use the filters to select a template based on use case, framework, and other requirements.Not sure which one to use? How about exploring Next.js.Viewing the templates marketplaceDeploy the template to VercelOnce you've selected a template, Click Deploy on the template page to start the process.Deploying your chosen templateConnect your Git providerTo ensure you can easily update your project after deploying it, Vercel will create a new repository with your chosen Git provider. Every push to that Git repository will be deployed automatically.First, select the Git provider that you'd like to connect to. Once you’ve signed in, you’ll need to set the scope and repository name. At this point, Vercel will clone a copy of the source code into your Git account.Connecting your Git provider and creating a new repositoryProject deploymentOnce the project has been cloned to your git provider, Vercel will automatically start deploying the project. This starts with building your project, then assigning the domain, and finally celebrating your deployed project with confetti.Deploying a templateView your dashboardAt this point, you’ve created a production deployment, with its very own domain assigned. If you continue to your dashboard, you can click on the domain to preview a live, accessible URL that is instantly available on the internet.Viewing your deployment informationZoom ImageViewing your deployment informationClone the project to your machineFinally, you'll want to clone the source files to your local machine so that you can make some changes later. To do this from your dashboard, select the Git repository button and clone the repository.
Because you used a template, we’ve automatically included any additional
environment set up as part of the template. You can customize your project by
configuring environment variables and build options.Environment Variables are key-value pairs that can be defined in your project settings
for each Environment. Teams can also
use shared environment variables
that are linked between multiple projects.Vercel automatically configures builds settings based on your framework, but
you can customize the build in your
project settings or within a vercel.json file.

However, you can also configure the Project settings at this point including the build and output settings and Environment Variables. These can also be set later.
To update the framework, build command, output directory, install command, or development command, expand the Build & Output Settings section and update as needed.
To set environment variables, expand the Environment Variables section and either paste or copy them in.
You can also configure additional properties by adding a vercel.json to your project. You can either do this now, before you deploy, or add it later and redeploy your project.

Already have a domain you love? Seamlessly integrate it with Vercel to leverage the platform's powerful features and infrastructure. Whether you're migrating an existing project or want to maintain your established online presence, you can use the steps below to add your custom domain.
Go to your project's domains settingsSelect your project and select the Settings tab. Then, select the Domains menu item.Add your existing domain to your projectFrom the Domains page, enter the domain you wish to add to the project.Connecting your Git provider and creating a new repositoryZoom ImageConnecting your Git provider and creating a new repositoryIf you add an apex domain (e.g. example.com) to the project, Vercel will prompt you to add the wwwsubdomain prefix, the apex domain, and some basic redirection options.For more information on which redirect option to choose, see Redirecting www domains.Configure your DNS recordsConfigure the DNS records of your domain with your registrar so it can be used with your Project. The dashboard will automatically display different methods for configuring it:Instructions on configuring an apex domain from the Project Domains page.
If the domain is in use by another Vercel account, you will need to verify access to the domain, with a TXT record
If you're using an Apex domain (e.g. example.com), you will need to configure it with an A record
If you're using a Subdomain (e.g. docs.example.com), you will need to configure it with a CNAME record
Both apex domains and subdomains can also be configured using the Nameservers method. Wildcard domains must use the nameservers method for verification. For more information see Add a custom domain.

Make Changes
Now that your project is publicly available on your domain of choice, it’s time to begin making changes to it. With Vercel's automatic deployments, this won't require any extra effort. By default, when your Vercel project is connected to a Git repository, Vercel will deploy every commit that is pushed to the Git repository, regardless of which branch you're pushing it to.
A Production environment is one built from the main or development branch of
your Git repository. A preview environment is created when you deploy from any
other branch.
Vercel provides a URL that reflects the latest pushes to that branch. You can find this either on your dashboard, or in a pull request, which you'll see in the next step
This connection was established for you automatically, so all you have to do is push commits, and you will start receiving links to deployments right on your Git provider.
Create a preview deployment
Make your changesCreate a new branch in your project and make some changesCommit your changesCommit those changes and create a pull request. After a few seconds, Vercel picks up the changes and starts to build and deploy your project. You can see the status of the build through the bot comment made on your PR:Vercel for GitHub deploying a pull request automatically.Inspect your deployment informationSelect Inspect to explore the build within your dashboard. You can see the build is within the preview environment and additional information about the deployment including: build information, a deployment summary, checks, and domain assignment. These happen for every deploymentVercel dashboard showing the preview deployment.View your deployment URLReturn to your pull request. At this point your build should be deployed and you can select Visit Preview. You can now see your changes and share this preview URL with others.
Commenting on previews
Comments provide a way for your team or friends to give direct feedback on preview deployments. Share with others by doing the following:
Open your deploymentOpen the preview deployment that you’d like to share by selecting the Domain from the deployment information as shown in step 3 above. Alternatively, you can find it by selecting your project from the dashboard, and selecting the most recent commit under Active Branches:Active branch section showing all non-production branchesAuthenticate with your Vercel accountFrom the Comments toolbar at the bottom of the screen, select Log in to comment and sign in with your Vercel account.Adjust the share settingsSelect Share in the Toolbar menu. Add the emails of people you would like to share the preview with. If you are previewing a specific commit, you may have the option to share the preview for your branch instead. This option allows you to share a preview that updates with the latest commit to the branch.To learn more, including other ways to share, see Sharing Deployments.Collaborator needs to sign-inThe person you are sharing the preview with needs to have a Vercel account. To do so, they'll need to select Log in to comment and then enter their email address.Collaborator can commentOnce the person you are sharing the preview with goes through the security options, they'll be ready to comment. You'll be notified of new comments through email, or when you visit the deployment.

Vercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your project.
Deploying on Vercel with one of our supported frameworks gives you access to many features, such as:

Vercel Functions enable developers to write functions that scale based on traffic demands, preventing failures during peak hours and reducing costs during low activity.
Edge Middleware is code that executes before a request is processed on a site, enabling you to modify the response. Because it runs before the cache, Edge Middleware is an effective way to personalize statically generated content.
Multi-runtime Support allows the use of various runtimes for your functions, each with unique libraries, APIs, and features tailored to different technical requirements.
Incremental Static Regeneration enables content updates without redeployment. Vercel caches the page to serve it statically and rebuilds it on a specified interval.
Speed Insights provide data on your project's Core Web Vitals performance in the Vercel dashboard, helping you improve loading speed, responsiveness, and visual stability.
Analytics offer detailed insights into your website's performance over time, including metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.
Skew Protection uses version locking to ensure that the client and server use the same version of your application, preventing version skew and related errors.

Build Output API
The Build Output API is a file-system-based specification for a directory structure that produces a Vercel deployment. It is primarily targeted at framework authors who want to integrate their frameworks with Vercel's platform features. By implementing this directory structure as the output of their build command, framework authors can utilize all Vercel platform features, such as Serverless Functions, Edge Functions, Routing, and Caching.
If you are not using a framework, you can still use these features by manually creating and populating the .vercel/output directory according to this specification. Complete examples of Build Output API directories can be found in vercel/examples, and you can read our blog post on using the Build Output API to build your own framework with Vercel.

While Next.js works when self-hosting, deploying to Vercel is zero-configuration and provides additional enhancements for scalability, availability, and performance globally.
Getting started
To get started with Next.js on Vercel:If you already have a project with Next.js, install Vercel CLI and run the vercel command from your project's root directoryClone one of our Next.js example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:Deploy our Next.js template, or view a live example.DeployLive ExampleOr, choose a template from Vercel's marketplace:Get started in minutesDeploy a new  Next.js project with a templateView All TemplatesNext.js App Router PlaygroundExamples of many Next.js App Router features.Image Gallery StarterAn image gallery built on Next.js and Cloudinary.Next.js BoilerplateGet started with Next.js and React in seconds.View All TemplatesVercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Next.js project.
Incremental Static Regeneration
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to create or update content without redeploying your site. ISR has three main benefits for developers: better performance, improved security, and faster build times.
When self-hosting, (ISR) is limited to a single region workload. Statically generated pages are not distributed closer to visitors by default, without additional configuration or vendoring of a CDN. By default, self-hosted ISR does not persist generated pages to durable storage. Instead, these files are located in the Next.js cache (which expires).

To enable ISR with Next.js in the app router, add an options object with a revalidate property to your fetch requests:
Next.js (/app)Next.js (/pages)apps/example/page.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptawait fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog', {
  next: { revalidate: 10 }, // Seconds
});



To summarize, using ISR with Next.js on Vercel:

Better performance with our global Edge Network
Zero-downtime rollouts to previously statically generated pages
Framework-aware infrastructure enables global content updates in 300ms
Generated pages are both cached and persisted to durable storage

Learn more about Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request.
On Vercel, you can server-render Next.js applications through Vercel Functions.
To summarize, SSR with Next.js on Vercel:

Scales to zero when not in use
Scales automatically with traffic increases
Has zero-configuration support for Cache-Control headers, including stale-while-revalidate
Framework-aware infrastructure enables automatic creation of Functions for SSR

Learn more about SSR
Streaming
Vercel supports streaming in Next.js projects with any of the following:

Route Handlers
Vercel Functions
React Server Components

Streaming data allows you to fetch information in chunks rather than all at once, speeding up Function responses. You can use streams to improve your app's user experience and prevent your functions from failing when fetching large files.
Streaming with loading and Suspense
In the Next.js App Router, you can use the loading file convention or a Suspense component to show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads.
The loading file provides a way to show a loading state for a whole route or route-segment, instead of just particular sections of a page. This file affects all its child elements, including layouts and pages. It continues to display its contents until the data fetching process in the route segment completes.
The following example demonstrates a basic loading file:

loading.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default function Loading() {
  return <p>Loading...</p>;
}
Learn more about loading in the Next.js docs.
The Suspense component, introduced in React 18, enables you to display a fallback until components nested within it have finished loading. Using Suspense is more granular than showing a loading state for an entire route, and is useful when only sections of your UI need a loading state.
You can specify a component to show during the loading state with the fallback prop on the Suspense component as shown below:
app/dashboard/page.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { Suspense } from 'react';
import { PostFeed, Weather } from './components';
 
export default function Posts() {
  return (
    <section>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>
        <PostFeed />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>
        <Weather />
      </Suspense>
    </section>
  );
}

To summarize, using Streaming with Next.js on Vercel:

Speeds up Function response times, improving your app's user experience
Display initial loading UI with incremental updates from the server as new data becomes available

Learn more about Streaming with Vercel Functions.
Partial Prerendering
Partial Prerendering as an experimental feature. It is currently 
not suitable for production environments.
Partial Prerendering (PPR) is an experimental feature in Next.js that allows the static portions of a page to be pre-generated and served from the cache, while the dynamic portions are streamed in a single HTTP request.
When a user visits a route:

A static route shell is served immediately, this makes the initial load fast.
The shell leaves holes where dynamic content will be streamed in to minimize the perceived overall page load time.
The async holes are loaded in parallel, reducing the overall load time of the page.

This approach is useful for pages like dashboards, where unique, per-request data coexists with static elements such as sidebars or layouts. This is different from how your application behaves today, where entire routes are either fully static or dynamic.
See the Partial Prerendering docs to learn more.
Image Optimization
Image Optimization helps you achieve faster page loads by reducing the size of images and using modern image formats.
When deploying to Vercel, images are automatically optimized on demand, keeping your build times fast while improving your page load performance and Core Web Vitals.
When self-hosting, Image Optimization uses the default Next.js server for optimization. This server manages the rendering of pages and serving of static files.
To use Image Optimization with Next.js on Vercel, import the next/image component into the component you'd like to add an image to, as shown in the following example:



Next.js (/app)Next.js (/pages)components/ExampleComponent.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport Image from 'next/image'
 
interface ExampleProps {
  name: string;
}
 
const ExampleComponent = (props: ExampleProps) : => {
  return (
    <>
      <Image
        src="example.png"
        alt="Example picture"
        width={500}
        height={500}
      />
      <span>{props.name}</span>
    </>
  )
}
To summarize, using Image Optimization with Next.js on Vercel:

Zero-configuration Image Optimization when using next/image
Helps your team ensure great performance by default
Keeps your builds fast by optimizing images on-demand
Requires No additional services needed to procure or set up

Font Optimization
next/font enables built-in automatic self-hosting for any font file. This means you can optimally load web fonts with zero layout shift, thanks to the underlying CSS size-adjust property.
This also allows you to use all Google Fonts with performance and privacy in mind. CSS and font files are downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static files. No requests are sent to Google by the browser.



Next.js (/app)Next.js (/pages)app/layout.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
 
// If loading a variable font, you don't need to specify the font weight
const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap',
});
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={inter.className}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
To summarize, using Font Optimization with Next.js on Vercel:

Enables built-in, automatic self-hosting for font files
Loads web fonts with zero layout shift
Allows for CSS and font files to be downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static files
Ensures that no requests are sent to Google by the browser

Open Graph Images
Dynamic social card images (using the Open Graph protocol) allow you to create a unique image for every page of your site. This is useful when sharing links on the web through social platforms or through text message.
The Vercel OG image generation library allows you generate fast, dynamic social card images using Next.js API Routes.
The following example demonstrates using OG image generation in both the Next.js Pages and App Router:


Next.js (/app)Next.js (/pages)app/api/og/route.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og';
// App router includes @vercel/og.
// No need to install it.
 
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div
        style={{
          fontSize: 128,
          background: 'white',
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
          display: 'flex',
          textAlign: 'center',
          alignItems: 'center',
          justifyContent: 'center',
        }}
      >
        Hello world!
      </div>
    ),
    {
      width: 1200,
      height: 600,
    },
  );
}

To see your generated image, run npm run dev in your terminal and visit the /api/og route in your browser (most likely http://localhost:3000/api/og).
To summarize, the benefits of using Vercel OG with Next.js include:

Instant, dynamic social card images without needing headless browsers
Generated images are automatically cached on the Vercel Edge Network
Image generation is co-located with the rest of your frontend codebase

Learn more about OG Image Generation
Middleware
Middleware is code that executes before a request is processed. Because Middleware runs before the cache, it's an effective way of providing personalization to statically generated content.
When deploying middleware with Next.js on Vercel, you get access to built-in helpers that expose each request's geolocation information. You also get access to the NextRequest and NextResponse objects, which enable rewrites, continuing the middleware chain, and more.
See the Middleware API docs for more information.
To summarize, Middleware with Next.js on Vercel:

Runs using Edge Middleware which are deployed globally
Replaces needing additional services for customizable routing rules
Helps you achieve the best performance for serving content globally

Learn more about Edge Middleware
Draft Mode
Draft Mode enables you to view draft content from your Headless CMS immediately, while still statically generating pages in production.
See our Draft Mode docs to learn how to use it with Next.js.
Self-hosting Draft Mode
When self-hosting, every request using Draft Mode hits the Next.js server, potentially incurring extra load or cost. Further, by spoofing the cookie, malicious users could attempt to gain access to your underlying Next.js server.
Draft Mode security
Deployments on Vercel automatically secure Draft Mode behind the same authentication used for Preview Comments. In order to enable or disable Draft Mode, the viewer must be logged in as a member of the Team. Once enabled, Vercel's Edge Network will bypass the ISR cache automatically and invoke the underlying Serverless Function.
Enabling Draft Mode in Preview Deployments
You and your team members can toggle Draft Mode in the Vercel Toolbar in production, localhost, and Preview Deployments. When you do so, the toolbar will become purple to indicate Draft Mode is active.
The Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.
Users outside your Vercel team cannot toggle Draft Mode.
To summarize, the benefits of using Draft Mode with Next.js on Vercel include:

Easily server-render previews of static pages
Adds additional security measures to prevent malicious usage
Integrates with any headless provider of your choice
You can enable and disable Draft Mode in the comments toolbar on Preview Deployments

Learn more about Draft Mode
Web Analytics
Vercel's Web Analytics features enable you to visualize and monitor your application's performance over time. The Analytics tab in your project's dashboard offers detailed insights into your website's visitors, with metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.
To use Web Analytics, navigate to the Analytics tab of your project dashboard on Vercel and select Enable in the modal that appears.
To track visitors and page views, we recommend first installing our @vercel/analytics package by running the terminal command below in the root directory of your Next.js project:
pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm i @vercel/analytics
Then, follow the instructions below to add the Analytics component to your app either using the pages directory or the app directory.



The Analytics component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with Next.js, including route support.Add the following code to the root layout:
Next.js (/app)Next.js (/pages)app/layout.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Next.js</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

To summarize, Web Analytics with Next.js on Vercel:

Enables you to track traffic and see your top-performing pages
Offers you detailed breakdowns of visitor demographics, including their OS, browser, geolocation, and more

Learn more about Web Analytics
Speed Insights
You can see data about your project's Core Web Vitals performance in your dashboard on Vercel. Doing so will allow you to track your web application's loading speed, responsiveness, and visual stability so you can improve the overall user experience.
On Vercel, you can track your Next.js app's Core Web Vitals in your project's dashboard.
reportWebVitals
If you're self-hosting your app, you can use the useWebVitals hook to send metrics to any analytics provider. The following example demonstrates a custom WebVitals component that you can use in your app's root layout file:app/_components/web-vitals.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScript'use client';
 
import { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals';
 
export function WebVitals() {
  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {
    console.log(metric);
  });
}You could then reference your custom WebVitals component like this:app/layout.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { WebVitals } from './_components/web-vitals';
 
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <WebVitals />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

Next.js uses Google's web-vitals library to measure the Web Vitals metrics available in reportWebVitals.
To summarize, tracking Web Vitals with Next.js on Vercel:

Enables you to track traffic performance metrics, such as First Contentful Paint, or First Input Delay
Enables you to view performance analytics by page name and URL for more granular analysis
Shows you a score for your app's performance on each recorded metric, which you can use to track improvements or regressions

You can deploy your SvelteKit projects to Vercel with zero configuration, enabling you to use Preview Deployments, Web Analytics, Serverless Functions, and more.
Get started with SvelteKit on Vercel
To get started with SvelteKit on Vercel:If you already have a project with SvelteKit, install Vercel CLI and run the vercel command from your project's root directoryClone one of our SvelteKit example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:Deploy our SvelteKit template, or view a live example.DeployLive ExampleOr, choose a template from Vercel's marketplace:Get started in minutesDeploy a new  SvelteKit project with a templateView All TemplatesSvelteKit BoilerplateA SvelteKit app including nested routes, layouts, and page endpoints.SvelteKit AuthenticationA SvelteKit app with authentication.SvelteKit CommerceAn all-in-one starter kit for high-performance e-commerce sites built with SvelteKit.View All TemplatesVercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your SvelteKit project.
Use Vercel features with Svelte
When you create a new SvelteKit project with npm create svelte@latest, it installs adapter-auto by default. This adapter detects that you're deploying on Vercel and installs the @sveltejs/adapter-vercel plugin for you at build time.
We recommend installing the @sveltejs/adapter-vercel package yourself. Doing so will ensure version stability, slightly speed up your CI process, and allows you to configure default deployment options for all routes in your project.
The following instructions will guide you through adding the Vercel adapter to your SvelteKit project.
Install SvelteKit's Vercel adapter pluginYou can add the Vercel adapter to your SvelteKit project by running the following command:pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm i @sveltejs/adapter-vercelAdd the Vercel adapter to your Svelte configAdd the Vercel adapter to your svelte.config.js file, which should be at the root of your project directory.You cannot use TypeScript for your SvelteKit config
file.In your svelte.config.js file, import adapter from @sveltejs/adapter-vercel, and add your preferred options. The following example shows the default configuration, which uses the Node.js runtime (which run on Vercel Serverless Functions).svelte.config.jsimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-vercel';
 
export default {
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter(),
  },
};Learn more about configuring your Vercel deployment in our configuration section below.
Configure your SvelteKit deployment
You can configure how your SvelteKit project gets deployed to Vercel at the project-level and at the route-level.
Changes to the config object you define in svelte.config.js will affect the default settings for routes across your whole project. To override this, you can export a config object in any route file.
The following is an example of a svelte.config.js file that will deploy using server-side rendering in Vercel's Node.js 18.x serverless runtime:
svelte.config.jsimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-vercel';
 
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter({
      runtime: 'nodejs18.x',
    }),
  },
};
 
export default config;
You can also configure how individual routes deploy by exporting a config object. The following is an example of a route that will deploy on Vercel's Edge runtime:

+page.server.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { PageServerLoad } from './$types';
 
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};
 
export const load = ({ cookies }): PageServerLoad<any> => {
  // Load function code here
};
Learn about all the config options available in the SvelteKit docs. You can also see the type definitions for config object properties in the SvelteKit source code.
Configuration options
SvelteKit's docs have a comprehensive list of all config options available to you. This section will cover a select few options which may be easier to use with more context.
split
By default, your SvelteKit routes get bundled into one Function when you deploy your project to Vercel. This configuration typically reduces how often your users encounter cold starts.
In most cases, there is no need to modify this option.
Setting split: true in your Svelte config will cause your SvelteKit project's routes to get split into separate Vercel Functions.
Splitting your Functions is not typically better than bundling them. You may want to consider setting split: true if you're experiencing either of the following issues:

You have exceeded the Function size limit for the runtime you're using. Batching too many routes into a single Function could cause you to exceed Function size limits for your Vercel account. See our Function size limits to learn more.
Your app is experiencing abnormally long cold start times. Batching Serverless Functions into one Function will reduce how often users experience cold starts. It can also increase the latency they experience when a cold start is required, since larger functions tend to require more resources. This can result in slower responses to user requests that occur after your Function spins down.

regions
Choosing a region allows you to reduce latency for requests to functions. If you choose a Function region geographically near dependencies, or nearest to your visitor, you can reduce your Functions' latency.
By default, your Vercel Functions will be deployed in Washington, D.C., USA, or iad1. Adding a region ID to the regions array will deploy your Serverless Functions there. See our Serverless Function regions docs to learn how to override this settings.
Streaming
Vercel supports streaming API responses over time with SvelteKit, allowing you to render parts of the UI early, then render the rest as data becomes available. Doing so lets users interact with your app before the full page loads, improving their perception of your app's speed. Here's how it works:

SvelteKit enables you to use a +page.server.ts file to fetch data on the server, which you can access from a +page.svelte file located in the same folder
You fetch data in a load function defined in +page.server.ts. This function returns an object

Top-level properties that return a promise will resolve before the page renders
Nested properties that return a promise will stream



The following example demonstrates a load function that will stream its response to the client. To simulate delayed data returned from a promise, it uses a sleep method.
src/routes/streaming-example/+page.server.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptfunction sleep(value: any, ms: number) {
  // Use this sleep function to simulate
  // a delayed API response.
  return new Promise((fulfill) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      fulfill(value);
    }, ms);
  });
}
export function load(event): PageServerLoad<any> {
  // Get some location data about the visitor
  const ip = event.getClientAddress();
  const city = decodeURIComponent(
    event.request.headers.get('x-vercel-ip-city') ?? 'unknown',
  );
  return {
    topLevelExample: sleep({ data: "This won't be streamed" }, 2000)
    // Stream the location data to the client
    locationData: {
      details: sleep({ ip, city }, 1000),
    },
  };
}

You could then display this data by creating the following +page.svelte file in the same directory:

src/routes/streaming-example/+page.svelteTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScript<script lang="ts">
  import type { PageData } from './$types'
  export let data: PageData;
</script>
 
<h1><span>Hello!</span></h1>
 
<div class="info">
  {#await data.locationData.details}
    <p>streaming delayed data from the server...</p>
  {:then details}
    <div>
      <p>City is {details.city}</p>
      <p>And IP is: {details.ip} </p>
    </div>
  {/await}
</div>
To summarize, Streaming with SvelteKit on Vercel:

Enables you to stream UI elements as data loads
Supports streaming through Vercel Functions
Improves perceived speed of your app

Learn more about Streaming on Vercel.
Server-Side Rendering
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, verifying authentication or checking the geolocation of an incoming request.
Vercel offers SSR that scales down resource consumption when traffic is low, and scales up with traffic surges. This protects your site from accruing costs during periods of no traffic or losing business during high-traffic periods.
SvelteKit projects are server-side rendered by default. You can configure individual routes to prerender with the prerender page option, or use the same option in your app's root +layout.js or +layout.server.js file to make all your routes prerendered by default.
While server-side rendered SvelteKit apps do support middleware, SvelteKit does not support URL rewrites from middleware.
See the SvelteKit docs on prerendering to learn more.
To summarize, SSR with SvelteKit on Vercel:

Scales to zero when not in use
Scales automatically with traffic increases
Has zero-configuration support for Cache-Control headers, including stale-while-revalidate

Learn more about SSR
Environment variables
Vercel provides a set of System Environment Variables that our platform automatically populates. For example, the VERCEL_GIT_PROVIDER variable exposes the Git provider that triggered your project's deployment on Vercel.
These environment variables will be available to your project automatically, and you can enable or disable them in your project settings on Vercel. See our Environment Variables docs to learn how.
Use Vercel environment variables with SvelteKit
SvelteKit allows you to import environment variables, but separates them into different modules based on whether they're dynamic or static, and whether they're private or public. For example, the '$env/static/private' module exposes environment variables that don't change, and that you should not share publicly.
System Environment Variables are private and you should never expose them to the frontend client. This means you can only import them from '$env/static/private' or '$env/dynamic/private'.
The example below exposes VERCEL_COMMIT_REF, a variable that exposes the name of the branch associated with your project's deployment, to a load function for a Svelte layout:

+layout.server.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { LayoutServerLoad } from './types';
import { VERCEL_COMMIT_REF } from '$env/static/private';
 
type DeploymentInfo = {
  deploymentGitBranch: string;
};
 
export function load(): LayoutServerLoad<DeploymentInfo> {
  return {
    deploymentGitBranch: 'Test',
  };
}
You could reference that variable in a corresponding layout as shown below:
+layout.svelte<script>
  /** @type {import('./$types').LayoutData} */
  export let data;
</script>
 
<p>This staging environment was deployed from {data.deploymentGitBranch}.</p>
To summarize, the benefits of using Environment Variables with SvelteKit on Vercel include:

Access to vercel deployment information, dynamically or statically, with our preconfigured System Environment Variables
Access to automatically-configured environment variables provided by integrations for your preferred services
Searching and filtering environment variables by name and environment in Vercel's dashboard

Learn more about Environment Variables
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
Incremental Static Regeneration allows you to create or update content without redeploying your site. When you deploy a route with ISR, Vercel caches the page to serve it to visitors statically, and rebuilds it on a time interval of your choice. ISR has three main benefits for developers: better performance, improved security, and faster build times.
See our ISR docs to learn more.
To deploy a SvelteKit route with ISR:

Export a config object with an isr property. Its value will be the number of seconds to wait before revalidating
To enable on-demand revalidation, add the bypassToken property to the config object. Its value gets checked when GET or HEAD requests get sent to the route. If the request has a x-prerender-revalidate header with the same value as bypassToken, the cache will be revalidated immediately

The following example demonstrates a SvelteKit route that Vercel will deploy with ISR, revalidating the page every 60 seconds, with on-demand revalidation enabled:

example-route/+page.server.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport const config = {
  isr: {
    expiration: 60,
    bypassToken: 'REPLACE_ME_WITH_SECRET_VALUE',
  },
};
Learn more about ISR with SvelteKit.
To summarize, the benefits of using ISR with SvelteKit on Vercel include:

Better performance with our global Edge Network
Zero-downtime rollouts to previously statically generated pages
Framework-aware infrastructure enables global content updates in 300ms
Generated pages are both cached and persisted to durable storage

Learn more about ISR
Skew Protection
New project deployments can lead to version skew. This can happen when your users are using your app and a new version gets deployed. Their deployment version requests assets from an older version. And those assets from the previous version got replaced. This can cause errors when those active users navigate or interact with your project.
SvelteKit has a skew protection solution. When it detects version skew, it triggers a hard reload of a page to sync to the latest version. This does mean the client-side state gets lost. With Vercel skew protection, client requests get routed to their original deployment. No client-side state gets lost. To enable it, visit the Advanced section of your project settings on Vercel.
Learn more about skew protection with SvelteKit.
To summarize, the benefits of using ISR with SvelteKit on Vercel include:

Mitigates the risk of your active users encountering version skew
Avoids hard reloads for current active users on your project

Learn more about skew protection on Vercel.
Image Optimization
Image Optimization helps you achieve faster page loads by reducing the size of images and using modern image formats.
When deploying to Vercel, you can optimize your images on demand, keeping your build times fast while improving your page load performance and Core Web Vitals.
To use Image Optimization with SvelteKit on Vercel, use the @sveltejs/adapter-vercel within your svelte.config.ts file.

svelte.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-vercel';
 
export default {
  kit: {
    adapter({
      images: {
        sizes: [640, 828, 1200, 1920, 3840],
        formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
        minimumCacheTTL: 300,
        domains: ['example-app.vercel.app'],
      }
    })
  }
};
This allows you to specify configuration options for Vercel's native image optimization API.
To use image optimization with SvelteKit, you have to construct your own srcset URLs. You can create a library function that will optimize srcset URLs in production for you like this:

src/lib/image.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { dev } from '$app/environment';
 
export function optimize(src: string, widths = [640, 960, 1280], quality = 90) {
  if (dev) return src;
 
  return widths
    .slice()
    .sort((a, b) => a - b)
    .map((width, i) => {
      const url = `/_vercel/image?url=${encodeURIComponent(src)}&w=${width}&q=${quality}`;
      const descriptor = i < widths.length - 1 ? ` ${width}w` : '';
      return url + descriptor;
    })
    .join(', ');
}
Use an img or any other image component with an optimized srcset generated by the optimize function:
src/components/image.svelteTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScript<script lang="ts">
  import { optimize } from '$lib/image';
  import type { Photo } from '$lib/types';
 
  export let photo: Photo;
</script>
 
<img
  class="absolute left-0 top-0 w-full h-full"
  srcset={optimize(photo.url)}
  alt={photo.description}
/>

To summarize, using Image Optimization with SvelteKit on Vercel:

Configure image optimization with @sveltejs/adapter-vercel
Optimize for production with a function that constructs optimized srcset for your images
Helps your team ensure great performance by default
Keeps your builds fast by optimizing images on-demand

Web Analytics
Vercel's Web Analytics features enable you to visualize and monitor your application's performance over time. The Analytics tab in your project's dashboard offers detailed insights into your website's visitors, with metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.
To use Web Analytics, navigate to the Analytics tab of your project dashboard on Vercel and select Enable in the modal that appears.
To track visitors and page views, we recommend first installing our @vercel/analytics package by running the terminal command below in the root directory of your SvelteKit project:
pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm i @vercel/analytics
In your SvelteKit project's main +layout.svelte file, add the following <script>:

With the above script added to your project, you'll be able to view detailed user insights in your dashboard on Vercel under the Analytics tab. See our docs to learn more about the user metrics you can track with Vercel's Web Analytics.
Your project must be deployed on Vercel to take advantage of the Web Analytics feature. Work on making this feature more broadly available is in progress.
To summarize, using Web Analytics with SvelteKit on Vercel:

Enables you to track traffic and see your top-performing pages
Offers you detailed breakdowns of visitor demographics, including their OS, browser, geolocation, and more

Learn more about Web Analytics
Speed Insights
You can see data about your project's Core Web Vitals performance in your dashboard on Vercel. Doing so will allow you to track your web application's loading speed, responsiveness, and visual stability so you can improve the user experience.
See our Speed Insights docs to learn more.
To summarize, using Speed Insights with SvelteKit on Vercel:

Enables you to track traffic performance metrics, such as First Contentful Paint, or First Input Delay
Enables you to view performance metrics by page name and URL for more
granular analysis
Shows you a score for your app's performance on each recorded metric, which you can use to track improvements or regressions

Learn more about Speed Insights
Draft Mode
Draft Mode enables you to view draft content from your Headless CMS immediately, while still statically generating pages in production.
To use a SvelteKit route in Draft Mode, you must:

Export a config object that enables Incremental Static Regeneration from the route's +page.server file:

blog/[slug]/+page.server.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { BYPASS_TOKEN } from '$env/static/private';
 
export const config = {
  isr: {
    // Random token that can be provided to bypass the cached version of the page with a __prerender_bypass=<token> cookie. Allows rendering content at request time for this route.
    bypassToken: BYPASS_TOKEN,
 
    // Expiration time (in seconds) before the cached asset will be re-generated by invoking the Serverless Function.
    // Setting the value to `false` means it will never expire.
    expiration: 60,
  },
};


Send a __prerender_bypass cookie with the same value as bypassToken in your config.

To render the draft content, SvelteKit will check for __prerender_bypass. If its value matches the value of bypassToken, it will render content fetched at request time rather than prebuilt content.
We recommend using a cryptographically secure random number generator at build
time as your bypassToken value. If a malicious actor guesses your
bypassToken, they can view your pages in Draft Mode.
Draft Mode security
Deployments on Vercel automatically secure Draft Mode behind the same authentication used for Preview Comments. In order to enable or disable Draft Mode, the viewer must be logged in as a member of the Team. Once enabled, Vercel's Edge Network will bypass the ISR cache automatically and invoke the underlying Serverless Function.
Enabling Draft Mode in Preview Deployments
You and your team members can toggle Draft Mode in the Vercel Toolbar in production, localhost, and Preview Deployments. When you do so, the toolbar will become purple to indicate Draft Mode is active.
The Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.
Users outside your Vercel team cannot toggle Draft Mode.
To summarize, the benefits of using Draft Mode with SvelteKit on Vercel include:

Easily server-render previews of static pages
Adds security measures to prevent malicious usage
Integrates with any headless provider of your choice
You can enable and disable Draft Mode in the comments toolbar on Preview Deployments

Learn more about Draft Mode
Edge Middleware
Edge Middleware is useful for modifying responses before they're sent to a user. We recommend using SvelteKit's server hooks to modify responses. Due to SvelteKit's client-side rendering, you cannot use Vercel's Edge Middleware with SvelteKit.
Rewrites
Adding a vercel.json file to the root directory of your project enables you to rewrite your app's routes.
We do not recommend using vercel.json rewrites with SvelteKit.
Rewrites from vercel.json only apply to the Vercel proxy. At runtime, SvelteKit doesn't have access to the rewritten URL, which means it has no way of rendering the intended rewritten route.

People choose Astro when they want to build content-rich experiences with as little JavaScript as possible.
You can deploy a static Astro app to Vercel with zero configuration.
Get Started with Astro on Vercel
To get started with Astro on Vercel:If you already have a project with Astro, install Vercel CLI and run the vercel command from your project's root directoryClone one of our Astro example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:Deploy our Astro template, or view a live example.DeployLive ExampleOr, choose a template from Vercel's marketplace:Get started in minutesDeploy a new  Astro project with a templateView All TemplatesAstroPaperA minimal, responsive and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme.Welcome to AstroThe official 'Getting Started' template for Astro.AstroshipStarter template for startups, marketing websites & blogs built with Astro and TailwindCSS.View All TemplatesVercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Astro project.
Using Vercel's features with Astro
To deploy a server-rendered Astro app, or a static Astro site with Vercel features like Web Analytics and Image Optimization, you must:


Add Astro's Vercel adapter to your project. There are two ways to do so:

Using astro add, which configures the adapter for you with default settings. Using astro add will generate a preconfigured astro.config.ts with opinionated default settings
pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm astro add vercel

Or, manually installing the @astrojs/vercel package. You should manually install the adapter if you don't want an opinionated initial configuration
pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm i @astrojs/vercel




Configure your project. In your astro.config.ts file, import either the serverless or static plugin, and set the output to server or static respectively:
Serverless SSRStaticastro.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
// Import /serverless for a Serverless SSR site
import vercelServerless from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';
 
export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server',
  adapter: vercelServerless(),
});


Enable Vercel's features using Astro's configuration options. The following example astro.config.ts enables Web Analytics and adds a maximum duration to Serverless Function routes:

astro.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
// Also can be @astrojs/vercel/static
import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';
 
export default defineConfig({
  // Also can be 'static' or 'hybrid'
  output: 'server',
  adapter: vercel({
    webAnalytics: {
      enabled: true,
    },
    maxDuration: 8,
  }),
});


Configuration options
The following configuration options enable Vercel's features for Astro deployments.
OptiontypeRenderingPurposemaxDurationnumberServerlessExtends or limits the maximum duration (in seconds) that Serverless Functions can run before timing out.webAnalytics{enabled: boolean}Static, ServerlessEnables Vercel's Web Analytics.

Also available with .vercelignore
For more details on the configuration options, see Astro's docs.
Server-Side Rendering
Using SSR, or on-demand rendering as Astro calls it, enables you to deploy your routes as Serverless Functions on Vercel. This allows you to add dynamic elements to your app, such as user logins and personalized content.
You can enable SSR by adding the Vercel adapter to your project.
If your Astro project is statically rendered, you can opt individual routes. To do so:


Set your output option to hybrid in your <PreferredExtension filename="astro.config" mjs />:

astro.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';
 
export default defineConfig({
  output: 'hybrid',
  adapter: vercel({
    edgeMiddleware: true,
  }),
});


Add export const prerender = false; to your components:
src/pages/mypage.astro---
export const prerender = false;
// ...
---
<html>
  <!-- Server-rendered page here... -->
</html>


SSR with Astro on Vercel:

Scales to zero when not in use
Scales automatically with traffic increases
Has zero-configuration support for Cache-Control headers, including stale-while-revalidate

Learn more about Astro SSR
Static rendering
Statically rendered, or pre-rendered, Astro apps can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration. To enable Vercel features like Image Optimization or Web Analytics, see Using Vercel's features with Astro.
You can opt individual routes into static rendering with export const prerender = true as shown below:
src/pages/mypage.astro---
export const prerender = true;
// ...
---
<html>
  <!-- Static, pre-rendered page here... -->
</html>
Statically rendered Astro sites on Vercel:

Require zero configuration to deploy
Can use Vercel features with astro.config.ts

Learn more about Astro Static Rendering
Incremental Static Regeneration
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to create or update content without redeploying your site. ISR has two main benefits for developers: better performance and faster build times.
To enable ISR in Astro, you need to use the Vercel adapter and set isr to true in your configuration in astro.config.mjs:

ISR function requests do not include search params, similar to requests in
static mode.
Using ISR with Astro on Vercel offers:

Better performance with our global Edge Network
Zero-downtime rollouts to previously statically generated pages
Global content updates in 300ms
Generated pages are both cached and persisted to durable storage

Learn more about ISR with Astro.
Vercel Functions
Vercel Functions use resources that scale up and down based on traffic demands. This makes them reliable during peak hours, but low cost during slow periods.
When you enable SSR with Astro's Vercel adapter, all of your routes will be server-rendered as Serverless Functions by default. Astro's Server Endpoints are the best way to define API routes with Astro on Vercel.
When defining an Endpoint, you must name each function after the HTTP method it represents. The following example defines basic HTTP methods in a Server Endpoint:
src/pages/methods.json.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { APIRoute } from 'astro/dist/@types/astro';
 
export const GET: APIRoute = ({ params, request }) => {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({
      message: 'This was a GET!',
    }),
  );
};
 
export const POST: APIRoute = ({ request }) => {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({
      message: 'This was a POST!',
    }),
  );
};
 
export const DELETE: APIRoute = ({ request }) => {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({
      message: 'This was a DELETE!',
    }),
  );
};
 
// ALL matches any method that you haven't implemented.
export const ALL: APIRoute = ({ request }) => {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({
      message: `This was a ${request.method}!`,
    }),
  );
};

Astro removes the final file during the build process, so the name of the file
should include the extension of the data you want serve (for example 
example.png.js will become 
/example.png).
Vercel Functions with Astro on Vercel:

Scale to zero when not in use
Scale automatically as traffic increases

Learn more about Vercel Functions
Image Optimization
Image Optimization helps you achieve faster page loads by reducing the size of images and using modern image formats. When deploying to Vercel, images are automatically optimized on demand, keeping your build times fast while improving your page load performance and Core Web Vitals.
Image Optimization with Astro on Vercel is supported out of the box with Astro's Image component. See the Image Optimization quickstart to learn more.
Image Optimization with Astro on Vercel:

Requires zero-configuration for Image Optimization when using Astro's Image component
Helps your team ensure great performance by default
Keeps your builds fast by optimizing images on-demand

Learn more about Image Optimization
Middleware
Edge Middleware is code that executes before a request is processed on a site, enabling you to modify the response. Because it runs before the cache, Edge Middleware is an effective way to personalize statically generated content.
Astro middleware allows you to set and share information across your endpoints and pages with a middleware.ts file in your src directory. The following example edits the global locals object, adding data which will be available in any .astro file:
src/middleware.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScript// This helper automatically types middleware params
import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware';
 
export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(({ locals }, next) => {
  // intercept data from a request
  // optionally, modify the properties in `locals`
  locals.title = 'New title';
 
  // return a Response or the result of calling `next()`
  return next();
});

Astro middleware is not the same as Vercel's Edge Middleware,
which has to be placed at the root directory of your project, outside 
src.
To add custom properties to locals in middleware.ts, you must declare a global namespace in your env.d.ts file:src/env.d.tsdeclare namespace App {
  interface Locals {
    title?: string;
  }
}
You can then access the data you added to locals in any .astro file, like so:
src/pages/middleware-title.astro---
const { title } = Astro.locals;
---
<h1>{title}</h1>
<p>The name of this page is from middleware.</p>
Deploying middleware at the Edge
You can deploy Astro's middleware at the Edge, giving you access to data in the RequestContext and Request, and enabling you to use Vercel's Edge Middleware helpers, such as geolocation() or ipAddress().
To use Astro's middleware at the Edge, set edgeMiddleware: true in your astro.config.ts file:

astro.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';
 
export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server',
  adapter: vercel({
    edgeMiddleware: true,
  }),
});
If you're using Vercel's Edge Middleware,
you do not need to set edgeMiddleware: true in your 
astro.config.ts file.
See Astro's docs on the limitations and constraints for using middleware at the Edge, as well as their troubleshooting tips.
Using Astro.locals in Edge Middleware
The Astro.locals object exposes data to your .astro components, allowing you to dynamically modify your content with middleware. To make changes to Astro.locals in Astro's middleware at the edge:


Add a new middleware file next to your src/middleware.ts and name it src/vercel-edge-middleware.ts. This file name is required to make changes to Astro.locals. If you don't want to update Astro.locals, this step is not required


Return an object with the properties you want to add to Astro.locals. :
For TypeScript, you must install the @vercel/edge package:pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm i @vercel/edgeThen, type your middleware function like so:
src/vercel-edge-middleware.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport type { RequestContext } from '@vercel/edge';
 
// Note the parameters are different from standard Astro middleware
export default function ({
  request,
  context,
}: {
  request: Request;
  context: RequestContext;
}) {
  // Return an Astro.locals object with a title property
  return {
    title: "Spider-man's blog",
  };
}



Using Vercel's Edge Middleware
Astro's middleware, which should be in src/middleware.ts, is distinct from Vercel Edge Middleware, which should be a middleware.ts file at the root of your project.
Vercel recommends using framework-native solutions. You should use Astro's middleware over Vercel's Edge Middleware wherever possible.
If you still want to use Vercel's Edge Middleware, see the Quickstart to learn how.
Rewrites
Rewrites only work for static files with Astro. You must use Vercel's Edge Middleware for rewrites. You should not use vercel.json to rewrite URL paths with astro projects; doing so produces inconsistent behavior, and is not officially supported.
Redirects
In general, Vercel recommends using framework-native solutions, and Astro has built-in support for redirects. That said, you can also do redirects with Vercel's Edge Middleware.
Redirects in your Astro config
You can do redirects on Astro with astro.config.ts the redirects config option as shown below:
astro.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
 
export default defineConfig({
  redirects: {
    '/old-page': '/new-page',
  },
});

Redirects in Server Endpoints
You can also return a redirect from a Server Endpoint using the redirect utility:
src/pages/links/[id].tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport async function GET({ params, redirect }): APIRoute {
  return redirect('/redirect-path', 307);
}

Redirects in components
You can redirect from within Astro components with Astro.redirect():
src/pages/account.astro---
import { isLoggedIn } from '../utils';
 
const cookie = Astro.request.headers.get('cookie');
 
// If the user is not logged in, redirect them to the login page
if (!isLoggedIn(cookie)) {
  return Astro.redirect('/login');
}
---
 
<h1>You can only see this page while logged in</h1>
Astro Middleware on Vercel:

Executes before a request is processed on a site, allowing you to modify responses to user requests
Runs on all requests, but can be scoped to specific paths through a matcher config
Uses Vercel's lightweight Edge Runtime to keep costs low and responses fast

Learn more about Edge Middleware
Caching
Vercel automatically caches static files at the Edge after the first request, and stores them for up to 31 days on Vercel's Edge Network. Dynamic content can also be cached, and both dynamic and static caching behavior can be configured with Cache-Control headers.
The following Astro component will show a new time every 10 seconds. It does by setting a 10 second max age on the contents of the page, then serving stale content while new content is being rendered on the server when that age is exceeded.
Learn more about Cache Control options.
src/pages/ssr-with-swr-caching.astro---
Astro.response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 's-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate');
const time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
---
 
<h1>{time}</h1>
CDN Cache-Control headers
You can also control how the cache behaves on any CDNs you may be using outside of Vercel's Edge Network with CDN Cache-Control Headers.
The following example tells downstream CDNs to cache the content for 60 seconds, and Vercel's Edge Network to cache it for 3600 seconds:
src/pages/ssr-with-swr-caching.astro---
Astro.response.headers.set('Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control', 'max-age=3600',);
Astro.response.headers.set('CDN-Cache-Control', 'max-age=60',);
const time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
---
 
<h1>{time}</h1>
Learn more about CDN Cache-Control headers.
Caching on Vercel:

Automatically optimizes and caches assets for the best performance
Requires no additional services to procure or set up
Supports zero-downtime rollouts

It offers server-side rendering, SEO features, automatic code splitting, prerendering, and more out of the box. It also has an extensive catalog of community-built modules, which allow you to integrate popular tools with your projects.
You can deploy Nuxt static and server-side rendered sites on Vercel with no configuration required.
Getting started
To get started with Nuxt on Vercel:If you already have a project with Nuxt, install Vercel CLI and run the vercel command from your project's root directoryClone one of our Nuxt example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:Deploy our Nuxt template, or view a live example.DeployLive ExampleOr, choose a template from Vercel's marketplace:Get started in minutesDeploy a new  Nuxt project with a templateView All TemplatesNuxt.js 3 BoilerplateA Nuxt.js 3 app, bootstrapped with create-nuxt-app.OnelinkA link-in-bio SaaS built with Nuxt.js, where the data lives in the URL – no database required.LogspotOpen source changelog template made with Nuxt, Vue, and Tailwindcss.View All TemplatesVercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Nuxt project.
Choosing a build command
The following table outlines the differences between nuxt build and nuxt generate on Vercel:
Featurenuxt buildnuxt generateDefault build commandYesNoSupports all Vercel features out of the boxYesNo, must set nitro.static to trueSupports SSRYesNoSupports SSGYes, with nuxt configYesSupports ISRYesNo
In general, nuxt build is likely best for most use cases. Consider using nuxt generate to build fully static sites.
Editing your Nuxt config
You can configure your Nuxt deployment by creating a Nuxt config file in your project's root directory. It can be a TypeScript, JavaScript, or MJS file, but the Nuxt team recommends using TypeScript. Using TypeScript will allow your editor to suggest the correct names for configuration options, which can help mitigate typos.
Your Nuxt config file should default export defineNuxtConfig by default, which you can add an options object to.
The following is an example of a Nuxt config file with no options defined:
nuxt.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Config options here
});

See the Nuxt Configuration Reference docs for a list of available options.
Using routeRules
With the routeRules config option, you can:

Create redirects
Modify a route's response headers
Enable ISR
Deploy specific routes statically
Deploy specific routes with SSR
and more

At the moment, there is no way to configure route deployment options within
your page components, but development of this feature is in progress.
The following is an example of a Nuxt config that:

Creates a redirect
Modifies a route's response headers
Opts a set of routes into client-side rendering


nuxt.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/examples/*': { redirect: '/redirect-route' },
    '/modify-headers-route': { headers: { 'x-magic-of': 'nuxt and vercel' } },
    // Enables client-side rendering
    '/spa': { ssr: false },
  },
});
To learn more about routeRules:

Read Nuxt's reference docs to learn more about the available route options
Read the Nitro Engine's Cache API docs to learn about cacheing individual routes

Vercel Functions
Vercel Functions enable developers to write functions that uses resources that scale up and down based on traffic demands. This prevents them from failing during peak hours, but keeps them from running up high costs during periods of low activity.
Nuxt deploys routes defined in /server/api, /server/routes, and /server/middleware as one server-rendered Function by default. Nuxt Pages, APIs, and Middleware routes get bundled into a single Vercel Function.
The following is an example of a basic API Route in Nuxt:
server/api/hello.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineEventHandler(() => 'Hello World!');

You can test your API Routes with nuxt dev.
Reading and writing files
You can read and write server files with Nuxt on Vercel. One way to do this is by using Nitro with Vercel Functions and the Vercel KV driver. Use Nitro's server assets to include files in your project deployment. Assets within server/assets get included by default.
To access server assets, you can use Nitro's storage API:
server/api/storage.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineEventHandler(async () => {
  // https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/assets#server-assets
  const assets = useStorage('assets:server');
  const users = await assets.getItem('users.json');
  return {
    users,
  };
});

To write files, mount KV storage with the Vercel KV driver:
Update your nuxt.config.ts file.
nuxt.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineNuxtConfig({
  $production: {
    nitro: {
      storage: {
        data: { driver: 'vercelKV' },
      },
    },
  },
});

Use with the storage API.
server/api/storage.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const dataStorage = useStorage('data');
  await dataStorage.setItem('hello', 'world');
  return {
    hello: await dataStorage.getItem('hello'),
  };
});

See an example code repository.
Middleware
Middleware is code that executes before a request gets processed. Because Middleware runs before the cache, it's an effective way of providing personalization to statically generated content.
Nuxt has two forms of Middleware:

Server middleware
Route middleware

Nuxt server middleware on Vercel
In Nuxt, modules defined in /server/middleware will get deployed as server middleware. Server middleware should not have a return statement or send a response to the request.
Server middleware is best used to read data from or add data to a request's context. Doing so allows you to handle authentication or check a request's params, headers, url, and more.
The following example demonstrates Middleware that:

Checks for a cookie
Tries to fetch user data from a database based on the request
Adds the user's data and the cookie data to the request's context

server/middleware/auth.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { getUserFromDBbyCookie } from 'some-orm-package';
 
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  // The getCookie method is available to all
  // Nuxt routes by default. No need to import.
  const token = getCookie(event, 'session_token');
 
  // getUserFromDBbyCookie is a placeholder
  // made up for this example. You can fetch
  // data from wherever you want here
  const { user } = await getUserFromDBbyCookie(event.request);
 
  if (user) {
    event.context.user = user;
    event.context.session_token = token;
  }
});

You could then access that data in a page on the frontend with the useRequestEvent hook. This hook is only available in routes deployed with SSR. If your page renders in the browser, useRequestEvent will return undefined.
The following example demonstrates a page fetching data with useRequestEvent:
example.vueTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScript<script>
  const event = useRequestEvent();
  const user = ref(event.context?.user);
</script>
 
<template>
    <div v-if="user">
      <h1>Hello, {{ user.name }}!</h1>
    </div>
    <div v-else>
      <p>Authentication failed!</p>
    </div>
</template>

Nuxt route middleware on Vercel
Nuxt's route middleware runs before navigating to a particular route. While server middleware runs in Nuxt's Nitro engine, route middleware runs in Vue.
Route middleware is best used when you want to do things that server middleware can't, such as redirecting users, or preventing them from navigating to a route.
The following example demonstrates route middleware that redirects users to a secret route:
middleware/redirect.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {
  console.log(
    `Heading to ${to.path} - but I think we should go somewhere else...`,
  );
 
  return navigateTo('/secret');
});

By default, route middleware code will only run on pages that specify them. To do so, within the <script> tag for a page, you must call the definePageMeta method, passing an object with middleware: 'middleware-filename' set as an option.
The following example demonstrates a page that runs the above redirect middleware:
redirect.vueTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScript<script>
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 'redirect'
})
</script>
 
<template>
  <div>
    You should never see this page
  </div>
</template>

To make a middleware global, add the .global suffix before the file extension. The following is an example of a basic global middleware file:
example-middleware.global.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(() => {
  console.log('running global middleware');
});

See a detailed example of route middleware in Nuxt's Middleware example docs.
Middleware with Nuxt on Vercel enables you to:

Redirect users, and prevent navigation to routes
Run authentication checks on the server, and pass results to the frontend
Scope middleware to specific routes, or run it on all routes

Learn more about Middleware
Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request.
Nuxt allows you to deploy your projects with a strategy called Universal Rendering. In concrete terms, this allows you to deploy your routes with SSR by default and opt specific routes out in your Nuxt config.
When you deploy your app with Universal Rendering, it renders on the server once, then your client-side JavaScript code gets interpreted in the browser again once the page loads.
On Vercel, Nuxt apps are server-rendered by default
SSR with Nuxt on Vercel:

Scales to zero when not in use
Scales automatically with traffic increases
Allows you to opt individual routes out of SSR with your Nuxt config

Learn more about SSR
Client-side rendering
If you deploy with nuxt build, you can opt nuxt routes into client-side rendering using routeRules by setting ssr: false as demonstrated below:
nuxt.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    // Use client-side rendering for this route
    '/client-side-route-example': { ssr: false },
  },
});

Static rendering
To deploy a fully static site on Vercel, build your project with nuxt generate. You should set nitro.static to true to enable Vercel features such as redirects, Image Optimization, and more when using nuxt generate:
nuxt.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    static: true,
  },
});

If you deploy with nuxt build, You can statically generate Nuxt routes at build time using the prerender option in your nuxt.config.ts:
nuxt.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    // prerender index route by default
    '/': { prerender: true },
    // prerender this route and all child routes
    '/prerender-multiple/**': { prerender: true },
  },
});

To verify that a route is prerendered at build time, check 
window.NUXT.prerenderedAt. You can also use the
Vue Telescope browser
extension
.
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to create or update content without redeploying your site. ISR has two main benefits for developers: better performance and faster build times.
To enable ISR in a Nuxt route, add a routeRules option to your nuxt.config.ts, as shown in the example below:
nuxt.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    // all routes (by default) will be revalidated every 60 seconds, in the background
    '/**': { isr: 60 },
    // this page will be generated on demand and then cached permanently
    '/static': { isr: true },
    // this page is statically generated at build time and cached permanently
    '/prerendered': { prerender: true },
    // this page will be always fresh
    '/dynamic': { isr: false },
  },
});

You should use the isr option rather than swr to enable ISR in a route. The isr option enables Nuxt to use Vercel's Edge Cache.
using ISR with Nuxt on Vercel offers:

Better performance with our global Edge Network
Zero-downtime rollouts to previously statically generated pages
Global content updates in 300ms
Generated pages are both cached and persisted to durable storage

Learn more about ISR with Nuxt.
Redirects and Headers
You can define redirects and response headers with Nuxt on Vercel in your nuxt.config.ts:

nuxt.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/examples/*': { redirect: '/redirect-route' },
    '/modify-headers-route': { headers: { 'x-magic-of': 'nuxt and vercel' } },
  },
});
Image Optimization
Image Optimization helps you achieve faster page loads by reducing the size of images and using modern image formats.
When deploying to Vercel, images are automatically optimized on demand, keeping your build times fast while improving your page load performance and Core Web Vitals.
To use Image Optimization with Nuxt on Vercel, follow the Image Optimization quickstart by selecting Nuxt from the dropdown.
Using Image Optimization with Nuxt on Vercel:

Requires zero-configuration for Image Optimization when using nuxt/image
Helps your team ensure great performance by default
Keeps your builds fast by optimizing images on-demand

Learn more about Image Optimization
Open Graph Images
Dynamic social card images allow you to create a unique image for pages of your site. This is great for sharing links on the web through social platforms or text messages.
To generate dynamic social card images for Nuxt projects, you can use nuxt-og-image. It uses the main Nuxt/Nitro Server-side rendering(SSR) function.
The following example demonstrates using Open Graph (OG) image generation with nuxt-og-image:

Create a new OG template

components/OgImage/Template.vueTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScript<script setup lang="ts">
  withDefaults(defineProps<{
    title?: string
  }>(), {
    title: 'title',
  })
</script>
<template>
  <div class="h-full w-full flex items-start justify-start border-solid border-blue-500 border-[12px] bg-gray-50">
    <div class="flex items-start justify-start h-full">
      <div class="flex flex-col justify-between w-full h-full">
        <h1 class="text-[80px] p-20 font-black text-left">
          {{ title }}
        </h1>
        <p class="text-2xl pb-10 px-20 font-bold mb-0">
          acme.com
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>


Use that OG image in your pages. Props passed get used in your open graph images.

pages/index.vueTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScript<script lang="ts" setup>
defineOgImageComponent('Template', {
  title: 'Is this thing on?'
})
</script>

To see your generated image, run your project and use Nuxt DevTools. Or you can visit the image at its URL /__og-image__/image/og.png.
Learn more about OG Image Generation with Nuxt.
Deploying legacy Nuxt projects on Vercel
The Nuxt team does not recommend deploying legacy versions of Nuxt (such as Nuxt 2) on Vercel, except as static sites. If your project uses a legacy version of Nuxt, you should either:

Implement Nuxt Bridge
Or upgrade with the Nuxt team's migration guide

If you still want to use legacy Nuxt versions with Vercel, you should only do so by building a static site with nuxt generate. We do not recommend deploying legacy Nuxt projects with server-side rendering.

Vite provides a dev server with rich feature enhancements such as pre-bundling NPM dependencies and hot module replacement, and a build command that bundles your code and outputs optimized static assets for production.
These features make Vite more desirable than out-of-the-box CLIs when building larger projects with frameworks for many developers.
Vite powers popular frameworks like SvelteKit, and is often used in large projects built with Vue, Svelte, React, Preact, and more.
Getting started
To get started with Vite on Vercel:If you already have a project with Vite, install Vercel CLI and run the vercel command from your project's root directoryClone one of our Vite example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:Deploy our Vite template, or view a live example.DeployLive ExampleOr, choose a template from Vercel's marketplace:Get started in minutesDeploy a new  Vite project with a templateView All TemplatesVue.jsVue.js app that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configurationVuepressVue-powered Static Site GeneratorVite - VueVite/Vue.js site that can be deployed to VercelView All TemplatesVercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Vite project.
Using Vite community plugins
Although Vite offers modern features like SSR and Serverless Functions out of the box, implementing those features can sometimes require complex configuration steps. Because of this, many Vite users prefer to use popular community plugins.
Vite's plugins are based on Rollup's plugin interface, giving Vite users access to many tools from the Rollup ecosystem as well as the Vite-specific ecosystem.
We recommend using Vite plugins to configure your project when possible.
vite-plugin-vercel
vite-plugin-vercel is a popular community Vite plugin that implements the Build Output API spec. It enables your Vite apps to use the following Vercel features:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Serverless Functions
Incremental Static Regeneration
Static Site Generation

When using the Vercel CLI, set the port as an environment variable. To allow Vite to access this, include the environment variable in your vite.config file:
vite.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import vercel from 'vite-plugin-vercel';
 
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: process.env.PORT as unknown as number,
  },
  plugins: [vercel()],
});

vite-plugin-ssr
vite-plugin-ssr is another popular community Vite plugin that implements the Build Output API spec. It enables your Vite apps to do the following:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Serverless Functions
Static Site Generation

Environment Variables
Vercel provides a set of System Environment Variables that our platform automatically populates. For example, the VERCEL_GIT_PROVIDER variable exposes the Git provider that triggered your project's deployment on Vercel.
These environment variables will be available to your project automatically, and you can enable or disable them in your project settings on Vercel. See our Environment Variables docs to learn how.
To access Vercel's System Environment Variables in Vite during the build process, prefix the variable name with VITE. For example, VITE_VERCEL_ENV will return preview, production, or development depending on which environment the app is running in.
The following example demonstrates a Vite config file that sets VITE_VERCEL_ENV as a global constant available throughout the app:

vite.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    define: {
      __APP_ENV__: process.env.VITE_VERCEL_ENV,
    },
  };
});
If you want to read environment variables from a .env file, additional configuration is required. See the Vite config docs to learn more.
To summarize, the benefits of using System Environment Variables with Vite on Vercel include:

Access to Vercel deployment information, dynamically or statically, with our preconfigured System Environment Variables
Access to automatically-configured environment variables provided by integrations for your preferred services
Searching and filtering environment variables by name and environment in Vercel's dashboard

Learn more about System Environment Variables
Vercel Functions
Vercel Functions scale up and down their resource consumption based on traffic demands. This scaling prevents them from failing during peak hours, but keeps them from running up high costs during periods of low activity.
If your project uses a Vite community plugin, such as vite-plugin-ssr, you should follow that plugin's documentation for using Vercel Functions.
If you're using a framework built on Vite, check that framework's official documentation or our dedicated framework docs. Some frameworks built on Vite, such as SvelteKit, support Functions natively. We recommend using that framework's method for implementing Functions.
If you're not using a framework or plugin that supports Vercel Functions, you can still use them in your project by creating routes in an api directory at the root of your project.
The following example demonstrates a basic Vercel Function defined in an api directory:

api/handler.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';
 
export default function handler(
  request: VercelRequest,
  response: VercelResponse,
) {
  response.status(200).json({
    body: request.body,
    query: request.query,
    cookies: request.cookies,
  });
}
To summarize, Vercel Functions on Vercel:

Scales to zero when not in use
Scales automatically with traffic increases
Support standard Web APIs, such as URLPattern, Response, and more

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request.
Vite exposes a low-level API for implementing SSR, but in most cases, we recommend using a Vite community plugin.
See the SSR section of Vite's plugin repo for a more comprehensive list of SSR plugins.
To summarize, SSR with Vite on Vercel:

Scales to zero when not in use
Scales automatically with traffic increases
Has zero-configuration support for Cache-Control headers, including stale-while-revalidate

Learn more about SSR
Using Vite to make SPAs
If your Vite app is configured to deploy as a Single Page Application (SPA), deep linking won't work out of the box.
To enable deep linking in SPA Vite apps, create a vercel.json file at the root of your project, and add the following code:
vercel.json{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
Deploying your app in Multi-Page App mode is recommended for production builds.
Learn more about Mutli-Page App mode in the Vite docs.

When used as a framework, React Router enables fullstack, server-rendered React applications. Its built-in features for nested pages, error boundaries, transitions between loading states, and more, enable developers to create modern web apps.
With Vercel, you can deploy React Router applications with server-rendering or static site generation (using SPA mode) to Vercel with zero configuration.
It is highly recommended that your application uses the Vercel
Preset when deploying to Vercel.
@vercel/react-router
The optional @vercel/react-router package contains Vercel specific utilities for use in React Router applications. The package contains various entry points for specific use cases:

@vercel/react-router/vite import

Contains the Vercel Preset to enhance React Router functionality on Vercel


@vercel/react-router/entry.server import

For situations where you need to define a custom entry.server file.



To get started, navigate to the root directory of your React Router project with your terminal and install @vercel/react-router with your preferred package manager:
pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm i @vercel/react-router
Vercel React Router Preset
When using the React Router as a framework, you should configure the Vercel Preset to enable the full feature set that Vercel offers.
To configure the Preset, add the following lines to your react-router.config file:
/react-router.config.tsimport { vercelPreset } from '@vercel/react-router/vite';
import type { Config } from '@react-router/dev/config';
 
export default {
  // Config options...
  // Server-side render by default, to enable SPA mode set this to `false`
  ssr: true,
  presets: [vercelPreset()],
} satisfies Config;
When this Preset is configured, your React Router application is enhanced with Vercel-specific functionality:

Allows function-level configuration (i.e. memory, maxDuration, etc.) on a per-route basis
Allows Vercel to understand the routing structure of the application, which allows for bundle splitting
Accurate "Deployment Summary" on the deployment details page

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request. Server-Side Rendering is invoked using Vercel Functions.
Routes defined in your application are deployed with server-side rendering by default.
The following example demonstrates a basic route that renders with SSR:
/app/routes.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { type RouteConfig, index } from '@react-router/dev/routes';
 
export default [index('routes/home.tsx')] satisfies RouteConfig;

/app/routes/home.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport type { Route } from './+types/home';
import { Welcome } from '../welcome/welcome';
 
export function meta({}: Route.MetaArgs) {
  return [
    { title: 'New React Router App' },
    { name: 'description', content: 'Welcome to React Router!' },
  ];
}
 
export default function Home() {
  return <Welcome />;
}

To summarize, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with React Router on Vercel:

Scales to zero when not in use
Scales automatically with traffic increases
Has framework-aware infrastructure to generate Vercel Functions
Supports the use of Vercel's Fluid compute for enhanced performance

Response streaming
Streaming HTTP responses with React Router on Vercel is supported with Vercel Functions. See the Streaming
with Suspense page in the React Router
docs for general instructions.
Streaming with React Router on Vercel:

Offers faster Function response times, improving your app's user experience
Allows you to return large amounts of data without exceeding Vercel Function response size limits
Allows you to display Instant Loading UI from the server with React Router's <Await>

Learn more about Streaming
Cache-Control headers
Vercel's Edge Network caches your content at the edge in order to serve data to your users as fast as possible. Static caching works with zero configuration.
By adding a Cache-Control header to responses returned by your React Router routes, you can specify a set of caching rules for both client (browser) requests and server responses. A cache must obey the requirements defined in the Cache-Control header.
React Router supports defining response headers by exporting a headers function within a route.
The following example demonstrates a route that adds Cache-Control headers which instruct the route to:

Return cached content for requests repeated within 1 second without revalidating the content
For requests repeated after 1 second, but before 60 seconds have passed, return the cached content and mark it as stale. The stale content will be revalidated in the background with a fresh value from your loader function

/app/routes/example.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { Route } from './+types/some-route';
 
export function headers(_: Route.HeadersArgs) {
  return {
    'Cache-Control': 's-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate=59',
  };
}
 
export async function loader() {
  // Fetch data necessary to render content
}

See our docs on cache limits to learn the max size and lifetime of caches stored on Vercel.
To summarize, using Cache-Control headers with React Router on Vercel:

Allow you to cache responses for server-rendered React Router apps using Vercel Functions
Allow you to serve content from the cache while updating the cache in the background with stale-while-revalidate

Learn more about Caching
Analytics
Vercel's Analytics features enable you to visualize and monitor your application's performance over time. The Analytics tab in your project's dashboard offers detailed insights into your website's visitors, with metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.
To use Analytics, navigate to the Analytics tab of your project dashboard on Vercel and select Enable in the modal that appears.
To track visitors and page views, we recommend first installing our @vercel/analytics package by running the terminal command below in the root directory of your React Router project:
pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm i @vercel/analytics
Then, follow the instructions below to add the Analytics component to your app. The Analytics component is a wrapper around Vercel's tracking script, offering a seamless integration with React Router.
Add the following component to your root file:
app/root.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';
 
export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

To summarize, Analytics with React Router on Vercel:

Enables you to track traffic and see your top-performing pages
Offers you detailed breakdowns of visitor demographics, including their OS, browser, geolocation and more

Learn more about Analytics
Using a custom server entrypoint
Your React Router application may define a custom server entrypoint, which is useful
for supplying a "load context" for use by the application's loaders and actions.
The server entrypoint file is expected to export a Web API-compatible function that
matches the following signature:
export default async function (request: Request) => Response | Promise<Response>;
To implement a server entrypoint using the Hono web framework, follow these steps:
First define the build.rollupOptions.input property in your Vite config file:
/vite.config.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { reactRouter } from '@react-router/dev/vite';
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';
 
export default defineConfig(({ isSsrBuild }) => ({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: isSsrBuild
      ? {
          input: './server/app.ts',
        }
      : undefined,
  },
  plugins: [tailwindcss(), reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()],
}));

Then, create the server entrypoint file:
/server/app.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { Hono } from 'hono';
import { createRequestHandler } from 'react-router';
 
// @ts-expect-error - virtual module provided by React Router at build time
import * as build from 'virtual:react-router/server-build';
 
declare module 'react-router' {
  interface AppLoadContext {
    VALUE_FROM_HONO: string;
  }
}
 
const app = new Hono();
 
// Add any additional Hono middleware here
 
const handler = createRequestHandler(build);
app.mount('/', (req) =>
  handler(req, {
    // Add your "load context" here based on the current request
    VALUE_FROM_HONO: 'Hello from Hono',
  }),
);
 
export default app.fetch;

To summarize, using a custom server entrypoint with React Router on Vercel allows you to:

Supply a "load context" for use in your loader and action functions
Use a Web API-compatible framework alongside your React Router application

Using a custom app/entry.server file
By default, Vercel supplies an implementation of the entry.server file which is configured
for streaming to work with Vercel Functions. This version will be used when
no entry.server file is found in the project.
However, your application may define a customized app/entry.server.jsx or app/entry.server.tsx
file if necessary. When doing so, your custom entry.server file should use the handleRequest
function exported by @vercel/react-router/entry.server.
For example, to supply the nonce option and set the corresponding Content-Security-Policy response header:
/app/entry.server.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { handleRequest } from '@vercel/react-router/entry.server';
import type { AppLoadContext, EntryContext } from 'react-router';
 
export default async function (
  request: Request,
  responseStatusCode: number,
  responseHeaders: Headers,
  routerContext: EntryContext,
  loadContext?: AppLoadContext,
): Promise<Response> {
  const nonce = crypto.randomUUID();
  const response = await handleRequest(
    request,
    responseStatusCode,
    responseHeaders,
    routerContext,
    loadContext,
    { nonce },
  );
  response.headers.set(
    'Content-Security-Policy',
    `script-src 'nonce-${nonce}'`,
  );
  return response;
}

Its built-in features for nested pages, error boundaries, transitions between loading states, and more, enable developers to create modern web apps.
With Vercel, you can deploy server-rendered Remix and Remix V2 applications to Vercel with zero configuration. When using the Remix Vite plugin, static site generation using SPA mode is also supported.
It is highly recommended that your application uses the Remix Vite plugin,
in conjunction with the Vercel Preset, when deploying
to Vercel.

@vercel/remix
The @vercel/remix package exposes useful types and utilities for Remix apps deployed on Vercel, such as:

json
defer
createCookie

To best experience Vercel features such as streaming, Vercel Functions, and more, we recommend importing utilities from @vercel/remix rather than from standard Remix packages such as @remix-run/node.
@vercel/remix should be used anywhere in your code that you normally would import utility functions from the following packages:

@remix-run/node
@remix-run/cloudflare
@remix-run/server-runtime

To get started, navigate to the root directory of your Remix project with your terminal and install @vercel/remix with your preferred package manager:
pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm i @vercel/remix
Vercel Vite Preset
When using the Remix Vite plugin (highly recommended), you should configure the Vercel Preset to enable the full feature set that Vercel offers.
To configure the Preset, add the following lines to your vite.config file:
/vite.config.tsimport { vitePlugin as remix } from '@remix-run/dev';
import { installGlobals } from '@remix-run/node';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';
import { vercelPreset } from '@vercel/remix/vite';
 
installGlobals();
 
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    remix({
      presets: [vercelPreset()],
    }),
    tsconfigPaths(),
  ],
});
Using this Preset enables Vercel-specific functionality such as rendering your Remix application with Vercel Functions.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request.
Remix routes defined in app/routes are deployed with server-side rendering by default.
The following example demonstrates a basic route that renders with SSR:
/app/routes/_index.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default function IndexRoute() {
  return (
    <div style={{ fontFamily: 'system-ui, sans-serif', lineHeight: '1.4' }}>
      <h1>This route is rendered on the server</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

Vercel Functions
Vercel Functions execute using Node.js. They enable developers to write functions that use resources that scale up and down based on traffic demands. This prevents them from failing during peak hours, but keeps them from running up high costs during periods of low activity.
Remix API routes in app/routes are deployed as Vercel Functions by default.
The following example demonstrates a basic route that renders a page with the heading, "Welcome to Remix with Vercel":
/app/routes/serverless-example.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptexport default function Serverless() {
  return <h1>Welcome to Remix with Vercel</h1>;
}

To summarize, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Remix on Vercel:

Scales to zero when not in use
Scales automatically with traffic increases
Has framework-aware infrastructure to generate Vercel Functions

Response streaming
Streaming HTTP responses with Remix on Vercel is supported with Vercel Functions. See the Streaming
page in the Remix docs for general instructions.
The following example demonstrates a route that simulates a throttled network by delaying a promise's result, and renders a loading state until the promise is resolved:
/app/routes/defer-route.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { Suspense } from 'react';
import { Await, useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';
import { defer } from '@vercel/remix';
 
function sleep(ms: number) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
 
export async function loader({ request }) {
  const version = process.versions.node;
 
  return defer({
    // Don't let the promise resolve for 1 second
    version: sleep(1000).then(() => version),
  });
}
 
export default function DeferredRoute() {
  const { version } = useLoaderData();
 
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={'Loading…'}>
      <Await resolve={version}>{(version) => <strong>{version}</strong>}</Await>
    </Suspense>
  );
}

To summarize, Streaming with Remix on Vercel:

Offers faster Function response times, improving your app's user experience
Allows you to return large amounts of data without exceeding Vercel Function response size limits
Allows you to display Instant Loading UI from the server with Remix's defer() and Await

Cache-Control headers
Vercel's Edge Network caches your content at the edge in order to serve data to your users as fast as possible. Static caching works with zero configuration.
By adding a Cache-Control header to responses returned by your Remix routes, you can specify a set of caching rules for both client (browser) requests and server responses. A cache must obey the requirements defined in the Cache-Control header.
Remix supports header modifications with the headers function, which you can export in your routes defined in app/routes.
The following example demonstrates a route that adds Cache Control headers which instruct the route to:

Return cached content for requests repeated within 1 second without revalidating the content
For requests repeated after 1 second, but before 60 seconds have passed, return the cached content and mark it as stale. The stale content will be revalidated in the background with a fresh value from your loader function

/app/routes/example.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport type { HeadersFunction } from '@vercel/remix';
 
export const headers: HeadersFunction = () => ({
  'Cache-Control': 's-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate=59',
});
 
export async function loader() {
  // Fetch data necessary to render content

See our docs on cache limits to learn the max size and lifetime of caches stored on Vercel.
To summarize, using Cache-Control headers with Remix on Vercel:

Allow you to cache responses for server-rendered Remix apps using Vercel Functions
Allow you to serve content from the cache while updating the cache in the background with stale-while-revalidate

Analytics
Vercel's Analytics features enable you to visualize and monitor your application's performance over time. The Analytics tab in your project's dashboard offers detailed insights into your website's visitors, with metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.
To use Analytics, navigate to the Analytics tab of your project dashboard on Vercel and select Enable in the modal that appears.
To track visitors and page views, we recommend first installing our @vercel/analytics package by running the terminal command below in the root directory of your Remix project:
pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm i @vercel/analytics
Then, follow the instructions below to add the Analytics component to your app. The Analytics component is a wrapper around Vercel's tracking script, offering a seamless integration with Remix.
Add the following component to your root file:
app/root.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';
 
export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

To summarize, Analytics with Remix on Vercel:

Enables you to track traffic and see your top-performing pages
Offers you detailed breakdowns of visitor demographics, including their OS, browser, geolocation and more

Using a custom app/entry.server file
By default, Vercel supplies an implementation of the entry.server file which is configured
for streaming to work with Vercel Functions. This version will be used when
no entry.server file is found in the project, or when the existing entry.server file has
not been modified from the base Remix template.
However, if your application requires a customized app/entry.server.jsx or app/entry.server.tsx
file (for example, to wrap the <RemixServer> component with a React context), you should
base it off of this template:
/app/entry.server.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { RemixServer } from '@remix-run/react';
import { handleRequest, type EntryContext } from '@vercel/remix';
 
export default async function (
  request: Request,
  responseStatusCode: number,
  responseHeaders: Headers,
  remixContext: EntryContext,
) {
  let remixServer = <RemixServer context={remixContext} url={request.url} />;
  return handleRequest(
    request,
    responseStatusCode,
    responseHeaders,
    remixServer,
  );
}

Using a custom server file
Defining a custom server file is not supported when using the Remix Vite
plugin on Vercel.
It's usually not necessary to define a custom server.js file within your Remix application when deploying to Vercel. In general, we do not recommend it.
If your project requires a custom server file, you will need to install @vercel/remix and import createRequestHandler from @vercel/remix/server. The following example demonstrates a basic server.js file:

server.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { createRequestHandler } from '@vercel/remix/server';
import * as build from '@remix-run/dev/server-build';
 
export default createRequestHandler({
  build,
  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  getLoadContext() {
    return {
      nodeLoadContext: true,
    };
  },
});

It enables developers to build fast and secure websites that integrate different content, APIs, and services.
Gatsby also has a large ecosystem of plugins and tools that improve the development experience. Vercel supports many Gatsby features, including Server-Side Rendering, Deferred Static Generation, API Routes, and more.
Get started with Gatsby on Vercel
To get started with Gatsby on Vercel:If you already have a project with Gatsby, install Vercel CLI and run the vercel command from your project's root directoryClone one of our Gatsby example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:Deploy our Gatsby template, or view a live example.DeployLive ExampleOr, choose a template from Vercel's marketplace:Get started in minutesDeploy a new  Gatsby project with a templateView All TemplatesGatsby 5 BoilerplateA Gatsby starter template using v5.Turborepo & Gatsby StarterThis is an official starter Turborepo with a Gatsby app, a Next.js app, and a React.js component library shared by both applications.View All TemplatesVercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your Gatsby project.
Using the Gatsby Vercel Plugin
Gatsby v4+ sites deployed to Vercel will automatically detect Gatsby usage and install the @vercel/gatsby-plugin-vercel-builder plugin.
To deploy your Gatsby site to Vercel, do not install the @vercel/gatsby-plugin-vercel-builder plugin yourself, or add it to your gatsby-config.js file.
Gatsby v5 sites require Node.js 18, which is currently the default version used for new Vercel builds.
Vercel persists your Gatsby project's .cache directory across builds.
Server-Side Rendering
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, verifying authentication or checking the geolocation of an incoming request.
Vercel offers SSR that scales down resource consumption when traffic is low, and scales up with traffic surges. This protects your site from accruing costs during periods of no traffic or losing business during high-traffic periods.
Using Gatsby's SSR API with Vercel
You can server-render pages in your Gatsby application on Vercel using Gatsby's native Server-Side Rendering API. These pages will be deployed to Vercel as Serverless Functions.
To server-render a Gatsby page, you must export an async function called getServerData. The function can return an object with several optional keys, as listed in the Gatsby docs. The props key will be available in your page's props in the serverData property.
The following example demonstrates a server-rendered Gatsby page using getServerData:

pages/example.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport type { GetServerDataProps, GetServerDataReturn } from 'gatsby';
 
type ServerDataProps = {
  hello: string;
};
 
const Page = (props: PageProps) => {
  const { name } = props.serverData;
  return <div>Hello, {name}</div>;
};
 
export async function getServerData(
  props: GetServerDataProps,
): GetServerDataReturn<ServerDataProps> {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`https://example-data-source.com/api/some-data`);
    return {
      props: await res.json(),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      status: 500,
      headers: {},
      props: {},
    };
  }
}
 
export default Page;
To summarize, SSR with Gatsby on Vercel:

Scales to zero when not in use
Scales automatically with traffic increases
Has zero-configuration support for Cache-Control headers, including stale-while-revalidate
Framework-aware infrastructure enables switching rendering between Edge/Node.js runtimes

Learn more about SSR
Deferred Static Generation
Deferred Static Generation (DSG) allows you to defer the generation of static pages until they are requested for the first time.
To use DSG, you must set the defer option to true in the createPages() function in your gatsby-node file.

pages/index.tsxTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport type { GatsbyNode } from 'gatsby';
 
export const createPages: GatsbyNode['createPages'] = async ({ actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions;
  createPage({
    defer: true,
    path: '/using-dsg',
    component: require.resolve('./src/templates/using-dsg.js'),
    context: {},
  });
};
See the Gatsby docs on DSG to learn more.
To summarize, DSG with Gatsby on Vercel:

Allows you to defer non-critical page generation to user request, speeding up build times
Works out of the box when you deploy on Vercel
Can yield dramatic speed increases for large sites with content that is infrequently visited

Learn more about DSG
Incremental Static Regeneration
Gatsby supports Deferred Static Generation.
The static rendered fallback pages are not generated at build time. This differentiates it from incremental static regeneration (ISR). Instead, a Vercel Function gets invoked upon page request. And the resulting response gets cached for 10 minutes. This is hard-coded and currently not configurable.
See the documentation for Deferred Static Generation.
API routes
You can add API Routes to your Gatsby site using the framework's native support for the src/api directory. Doing so will deploy your routes as Serverless Functions. These Serverless Functions can be used to fetch data from external sources, or to add custom endpoints to your application.
The following example demonstrates a basic API Route using Serverless Functions:

src/api/handler.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';
 
export default function handler(
  request: VercelRequest,
  response: VercelResponse,
) {
  response.status(200).json({
    body: request.body,
    query: request.query,
    cookies: request.cookies,
  });
}
To view your route locally, run the following command in your terminal:
terminalgatsby develop
Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/api/handler in your web browser.
Dynamic API routes
Vercel does not currently have first-class support for dynamic API routes in Gatsby. For now, using them requires the workaround described in this section.
To use Gatsby's Dynamic API routes on Vercel, you must:


Define your dynamic routes in a vercel.json file at the root directory of your project, as shown below:
vercel.json{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/blog/:id",
      "destination": "/api/blog/[id]"
    }
  ]
}


Read your dynamic parameters from req.query, as shown below:

api/blog/[id].tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';
 
export default function handler(
  request: VercelRequest & { params: { id: string } },
  response: VercelResponse,
) {
  console.log(`/api/blog/${request.query.id}`);
  response.status(200).json({
    body: request.body,
    query: request.query,
    cookies: request.cookies,
  });
}


Although typically you'd access the dynamic parameter with request.param
when using Gatsby, you must use request.query on Vercel.
Splat API routes
Splat API routes are dynamic wildcard routes that will match anything after the splat ([...]). Vercel does not currently have first-class support for splat API routes in Gatsby. For now, using them requires the workaround described in this section.
To use Gatsby's splat API routes on Vercel, you must:


Define your splat routes in a vercel.json file at the root directory of your project, as shown below:
vercel.json{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/products/:path*",
      "destination": "/api/products/[...]"
    }
  ]
}


Read your dynamic parameters from req.query.path, as shown below:

api/products/[...].tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';
 
export default function handler(
  request: VercelRequest & { params: { path: string } },
  response: VercelResponse,
) {
  console.log(`/api/products/${request.query.path}`);
  response.status(200).json({
    body: request.body,
    query: request.query,
    cookies: request.cookies,
  });
}


To summarize, API Routes with Gatsby on Vercel:

Scale to zero when not in use
Scale automatically with traffic increases
Can be tested as Vercel Functions in your local environment

Learn more about Gatsby API Routes
Edge Middleware
Gatsby does not have native framework support for using Edge Middleware.
However, you can still use Edge Middleware with your Gatsby site by creating a middeware.js or middeware.ts file in your project's root directory.
The following example demonstrates middleware that adds security headers to responses sent to users who visit the /example route in your Gatsby application:

middleware.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { next } from '@vercel/edge';
 
export const config = {
  // Only run the middleware on the example route
  matcher: '/example',
};
 
export default function middleware(request: Request): Response {
  return next({
    headers: {
      'Referrer-Policy': 'origin-when-cross-origin',
      'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
      'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
      'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control': 'on',
      'Strict-Transport-Security':
        'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload',
    },
  });
}
To summarize, Edge Middleware with Gatsby on Vercel:

Executes before a request is processed on a site, allowing you to modify responses to user requests
Runs on all requests, but can be scoped to specific paths through a matcher config
Uses our lightweight Edge Runtime to keep costs low and responses fast

Learn more about Edge Middleware
Speed Insights
Core Web Vitals are supported for Gatsby v4+ projects with no initial configuration necessary.
When you deploy a Gatsby v4+ site on Vercel, we automatically install the @vercel/gatsby-plugin-vercel-analytics package and add it to the plugins array in your gatsby-config.js file.
We do not recommend installing the Gatsby analytics plugin yourself.
To access your Core Web Vitals data, you must enable Vercel analytics in your project's dashboard. See our quickstart guide to do so now.
To summarize, using Speed Insights with Gatsby on Vercel:

Enables you to track traffic performance metrics, such as First Contentful Paint, or First Input Delay
Enables you to view performance analytics by page name and URL for more granular analysis
Shows you a score for your app's performance on each recorded metric, which you can use to track improvements or regressions

It sets up and configures a new React project with the latest JavaScript features, and optimizes your app for production.
Get Started with CRA on Vercel
To get started with CRA on Vercel:If you already have a project with CRA, install Vercel CLI and run the vercel command from your project's root directoryClone one of our CRA example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:Deploy our CRA template, or view a live example.DeployLive ExampleOr, choose a template from Vercel's marketplace:Get started in minutesDeploy a new  CRA project with a templateView All TemplatesCreate React AppA client-side React app created with create-react-app.Auth0 React StarterReact application that implements user login, logout and sign-up features using Auth0.View All TemplatesVercel deployments can integrate with your git provider to generate preview URLs for each pull request you make to your CRA project.
Static file caching
On Vercel, static files are replicated and deployed to every region in our global Edge Network after the first request. This ensures that static files are served from the closest location to the visitor, improving performance and reducing latency.
Static files are cached for up to 31 days. If a file is unchanged, it can persist across deployments, as their hash caches static files. However, the cache is effectively invalidated when you redeploy, so we always serve the latest version.
To summarize, using Static Files with CRA on Vercel:

Automatically optimizes and caches assets for the best performance
Makes files easily accessible through the public folder
Supports zero-downtime rollouts
Requires no additional services needed to procure or set up

Learn more about Static Files Caching
Preview Deployments
When you deploy your CRA app to Vercel and connect your git repo, every pull request will generate a Preview Deployment.
Preview Deployments allow you to preview changes to your app in a live deployment. They are available by default for all projects, and are generated when you commit changes to a Git branch with an open pull request, or you create a deployment using Vercel CLI.
Comments
You can use the comments feature to receive feedback on your Preview Deployments from Vercel Team members and people you share the Preview URL with.
Comments allow you to start discussion threads, share screenshots, send notifications, and more.
To summarize, Preview Deployments with CRA on Vercel:

Enable you to share previews of pull request changes in a live environment
Come with a comment feature for improved collaboration and feedback
Experience changes to your product without merging them to your deployment branch

Web Analytics
Vercel's Web Analytics features enable you to visualize and monitor your application's performance over time. The Analytics tab in your project's dashboard offers detailed insights into your website's visitors, with metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.
To use Web Analytics, navigate to the Analytics tab of your project dashboard on Vercel and select Enable in the modal that appears.
To track visitors and page views, we recommend first installing our @vercel/analytics package.
You can then import the inject function from the package, which will add the tracking script to your app. This should only be called once in your app.
Add the following code to your main app file:
main.tsTypeScriptTypeScriptJavaScriptimport { inject } from '@vercel/analytics';
 
inject();

Then, ensure you've enabled Web Analytics in your dashboard on Vercel. You should start seeing usage data in your Vercel dashboard.
To summarize, using Web Analytics with CRA on Vercel:

Enables you to track traffic and see your top-performing pages
Offers you detailed breakdowns of visitor demographics, including their OS, browser, geolocation and more

This allows your current site and your new site to operate simultaneously, enabling you to move different sections of your site at a pace that suits you.
In this guide, we'll explore incremental migration benefits and different strategies.
Why opt for incremental migration?
Incremental migrations offer several advantages:

Reduced risk due to smaller migration steps
A smoother rollback path in case of unexpected issues
Earlier technical implementation and business value validation
Downtime-free migration without maintenance windows

Disadvantages of one-time migrations
One-time migration involves developing the new site separately before switching traffic over. This approach has certain drawbacks:

Late discovery of expensive product issues
Difficulty in assessing migration success upfront
Potential for reaching a point of no-return, even with major problem detection
Possible business loss due to legacy system downtime during migration

When to use incremental migration?
Despite requiring more effort to make the new and legacy sites work concurrently, incremental migration is beneficial if:

Risk reduction and time-saving benefits outweigh the effort
The extra effort needed for specific increments to interact with legacy data
doesn't exceed the time saved

Incremental migration strategies

Incremental migration process
With incremental migration, legacy and new systems operate simultaneously. Depending on your strategy, you'll select a system aspect, like a feature or user group, to migrate incrementally.
Vertical migration
This strategy targets system features with the following process:

Identify all legacy system features
Choose key features for the initial migration
Repeat until all features have been migrated

Throughout, both systems operate in parallel with migrated features routed to the new system.
Horizontal migration
This strategy focuses on system users with the following process:

Identify all user groups
Select a user group for initial migration to the new system
Repeat until all users have been migrated

During migration, a subset of users accesses the new system while others continue using the legacy system.
Hybrid migration
A blend of vertical and horizontal strategies. For each feature subset, migrate by user group before moving to the next feature subset.

Two possible strategies can be applied:

Point your domain to Vercel from the beginning
Keep your domain on the legacy server

It's advisable to peruse the troubleshooting section before initiating the migration process.
Point your domain to Vercel
In this approach, you make Vercel the entry point for all your production traffic. When you begin, all traffic will be sent to the legacy server with rewrites and/or fallbacks. As you migrate different aspects of your site to Vercel, you can remove the rewrites/fallbacks to the migrated paths so that they are now served by Vercel.

Point your domain to Vercel approach
1. Deploy your application
Use the framework of your choice to deploy your application to Vercel
2. Re-route the traffic
Send all traffic to the legacy server using one of the following 3 methods:
Framework-specific rewrites
Use rewrites built-in to the framework such as configuring next.config.js with fallbacks and rewrites in Next.js
The code example below shows how to configure rewrites with fallback using next.config.js to send all traffic to the legacy server:
next.config.jsmodule.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return {
      fallback: [
        {
          source: '/:path*',
          destination: 'https://my-legacy-site.com/:path*',
        },
      ],
    };
  },
};
Vercel configuration rewrites
Use vercel.json for frameworks that do not have rewrite support. See the how do rewrites work documentation to learn how to rewrite to an external destination, from a specific path.
Edge Config
Use Edge Config with Edge Middleware to rewrite requests at the edge with the following benefits:

No need to re-deploy your application when rewrite changes are required
Immediately switch back to the legacy server if the new feature implementation is broken

Review this maintenance page example to understand the mechanics of this approach
This is an example middleware code for executing the rewrites at the edge:
middleware.tsimport { get } from '@vercel/edge-config';
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
 
export const config = {
  matcher: '/((?!api|_next/static|favicon.ico).*)',
};
 
export default async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const url = request.nextUrl;
  const rewrites = await get('rewrites'); // Get rewrites stored in Edge Config
 
  for (const rewrite of rewrites) {
    if (rewrite.source === url.pathname) {
      url.pathname = rewrite.destination;
      return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
    }
  }
 
  return NextResponse.next();
}
In the above example, you use Edge Config to store one key-value pair for each rewrite. In this case, you should consider Edge Config Limits (For example, 5000 routes would require around 512KB of storage). You can also rewrite based on URLPatterns where you would store each URLPattern as a key-value pair in Edge Config and not require one pair for each route.
3. Deploy to production
Connect your production domain to your Vercel Project. All your traffic will now be sent to the legacy server.
4. Deploy your first iteration
Develop and test the first iteration of your application on Vercel on specific paths.
With the fallback approach such as with the next.config.js example above, Next.js will automatically serve content from your Vercel project as you add new paths to your application. You will therefore not need to make any rewrite configuration changes as you iterate. For specific rewrite rules, you will need to remove/update them as you iterate.
Repeat this process until all the paths are migrated to Vercel and all rewrites are removed.
Keep your domain on the legacy server
In this approach, once you have tested a specific feature on your new Vercel application, you configure your legacy server or proxy to send the traffic on that path to the path on the Vercel deployment where the feature is deployed.

Keep your domain on the legacy server approach
1. Deploy your first feature
Use the framework of your choice to deploy your application on Vercel and build the first feature that you would like to migrate.
2. Add a rewrite or reverse proxy
Once you have tested the first feature fully on Vercel, add a rewrite or reverse proxy to your existing server to send the traffic on the path for that feature to the Vercel deployment.
For example, if you are using nginx, you can use the proxy_pass directive to send the traffic to the Vercel deployment.
Let's say you deployed the new feature at the folder new-feature of the new Next.js application and set its basePath to /new-feature, as shown below:
next.config.jsmodule.exports = {
  basePath: '/new-feature',
};
When deployed, your new feature will be available at https://my-new-app.vercel.app/.
You can then use the following nginx configuration to send the traffic for that feature from the legacy server to the new implementation:
nginx.confserver {
    listen 80;
    server_name legacy-server.com www.legacy-server.com;
 
    location /feature-path-on-legacy-server {
        proxy_pass https://my-new-app.vercel.app/;
    }
}
Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all the features have been migrated to Vercel. You can then point your domain to Vercel and remove the legacy server.
Troubleshooting
Maximum number of routes
Vercel has a limit of 1024 routes per deployment for rewrites. If you have more than 1024 routes, you may want to consider creating a custom solution using Middleware. For more information on how to do this in Next.js, see Managing redirects at scale.
Handling emergencies
If you're facing unexpected outcomes or cannot find an immediate solution for an unexpected behaviour with a new feature, you can set up a variable in Edge Config that you can turn on and off at any time without having to make any code changes on your deployment. The value of this variable will determine whether you rewrite to the new version or the legacy server.
For example, with Next.js, you can use the follow middleware code example:
middleware.tsimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { get } from '@vercel/edge-config';
 
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/'], // URL to match
};
 
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    // Check whether the new version should be shown - isNewVersionActive is a boolean value stored in Edge Config that you can update from your Project dashboard without any code changes
    const isNewVersionActive = await get<boolean>('isNewVersionActive');
 
    // If `isNewVersionActive` is false, rewrite to the legacy server URL
    if (!isNewVersionActive) {
      req.nextUrl.pathname = `/legacy-path`;
      return NextResponse.rewrite(req.nextUrl);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
Create an Edge Config and set it to { "isNewVersionActive": true }. By default, the new feature is active since isNewVersionActive is true. If you experience any issues, you can fallback to the legacy server by setting isNewVersionActive to false in the Edge Config from your Vercel dashboard.Last updated on March 4, 2025NextAccount ManagementWas this helpful?supported.SendOn this pagePoint your domain to Vercel1.

When your application is hosted across multiple servers, maintaining session information consistency can be challenging.
For example, if your legacy application is served on a different domain than your new application, the HTTP session cookies will not be shared between the two. If the data that you need to share is not easily calculable and derivable, you will need a central session store as in the use cases below:

Using cookies for storing user specific data such as last login time and recent viewed items
Using cookies for tracking the number of items added to the cart

If you are not currently using a central session store for persisting sessions or are considering moving to one, you can use Vercel KV.
Learn more about creating a session store and managing session data in our quickstart guide.
Bandwidth considerations
By pointing your domain to Vercel at the start of migration, all your traffic gets directed to Vercel, affecting your bandwidth usage. Be sure to account for potential additional costs associated with this approach.
The Usage tab on your dashboard can assist in monitoring your bandwidth usage.
User group strategies
Minimize risk and perform A/B testing by combining your migration by feature with a user group strategy. You can use Edge Config to store user group information and Edge Middleware to direct traffic appropriately.

Review our Edge Config feature flag template for a deeper understanding of this approach
You can also consult our guide on A/B Testing on Vercel for implementing this strategy

Using functions
Consider using Vercel Functions as you migrate your application.
This allows for the implementation of small, specific, and independent functionality units triggered by events, potentially enhancing future performance and reducing the risk of breaking changes. However, it may require refactoring your existing code to be more modular and reusable.
SEO considerations
Prevent the loss of indexed pages, links, and duplicate content when creating rewrites to direct part of your traffic to the new Vercel deployment. Consider the following:

Write E2E tests to ensure correct setting of canonical tags and robot indexing at each migration step
Account for existing redirects and rewrites on your legacy server, ensuring they are thoroughly tested during migration
Maintain the same routes for migrated feature(s) on Vercel

This account is used to manage your Vercel resources. Vercel has three types of plans:

Hobby
Pro
Enterprise

Each plan offers different features and resources, allowing you to choose the right plan for your needs.
When signing up for Vercel, you can choose to sign up with an email address or a Git provider.
Sign up with email
To sign up with email:

Enter your email address to receive the six-digit one-time password (OTP)
Enter the OTP to proceed with logging in successfully.

When signing up with your email, no Git provider will be connected by default. See login methods and connections for information on how to connect a Git provider. If no Git provider is connected, you will be asked to verify your account on every login attempt.
Sign up with a Git provider
You can sign up with any of the following supported Git providers:

GitHub
GitLab
Bitbucket

Authorize Vercel to access your Git provider account. This will be the default login connection on your account.
Once signed up you can manage your login connections in the authentication section of your dashboard.
Login methods and connections
You can manage your login connections in the Authentication section of your account settings. To find this section:

Select your profile picture near the top-right of the dashboard
Select Settings in the dropdown that appears
Select Authentication in the list near the left side of the page

The Authentication section of your account settings.
Login with passkeys
Passkeys allow you to log into your Vercel account using biometrics such as face or fingerprint recognition, PINs, hardware security keys, and more.
To add a new passkey:

From the dashboard, click your account avatar and select Settings. In your account settings, go to the Authentication item
Under Add New, select the Passkey button and then click Continue
Select the authenticator of preference. This list depends on your browser and your eligible devices. By default, Vercel will default to a password manager if you have one installed on your browser and will automatically prompt you to save the passkey
Follow the instructions on the device or with the account you've chosen as an authenticator

When you're done, the passkey will appear in a list of login methods on the Authentication page, alongside your other connections.
Logging in with SAML Single Sign-On
SAML Single Sign-On enables you to log into your Vercel Enterprise team with your organization's identity provider which manages your credentials.
Available only to Enterprise teams, this option can be configured by your team's administrator. To sign up for an Enterprise plan, contact sales.
Choosing a connection when creating a project
When you create an account on Vercel, you will be prompted to create a project by either importing a Git repository or using a template.
Either way, you must connect a Git provider to your account, which you'll be able to use as a login method in the future.
Using an existing login connection
Your Hobby team on Vercel can have only one login connection per third-party service. For example, you can only log into your Hobby team with a single GitHub account.
For multiple logins from the same service, create a new Vercel Hobby team.
Teams
Teams on Vercel let you collaborate with other members on projects and access additional resources.
Creating a team

Click on the scope selector at the top left of the nav bar
Choose to create a new team
Name your team
Depending on the types of team plans that you have already created, you'll be able to select a team plan option:

Selecting a team plan.
Collaborating with other members on projects is available on the Pro and Enterprise plans.
Upgrade from the Hobby plan to Pro to add team members.
Experience Vercel Pro for freeUnlock the full potential of Vercel Pro during your trial. Benefit from 10x more Data Transfer compared to the Hobby plan, 1 million Serverless Function requests, 1000 GB-hours of execution, and complimentary access to Speed Insights throughout your trial period.Start your free Pro trial
After creating a new trial, you'll have 14 days of Pro premium features and collaboration for free.
Team membership
You can join a Vercel team through an invitation from a team owner, automatic addition by a team's identity provider, or by requesting access yourself. To request access, you can push a commit to a private Git repository owned by the team.
Leaving a team
You can't leave a team if you are the last remaining
owner or the last confirmed
member.
To leave a team:

If there isn't another owner for your team, you must assign a different confirmed member as the team owner
Go to your team's dashboard and select the Settings tab
Scroll to the Leave Team section and select the Leave Team button
Click Confirm
If you are the only remaining member, you should delete the team instead

Deleting a team
To delete a team:

Remove all team domains
Go to your team's dashboard and select the Settings tab
Scroll to the Delete Team section and select the Delete Team button
Click Confirm

If you'd prefer to cease payment instead of deleting your team, you can downgrade to Hobby.
Default team
Your default team will be used when you make a request through the API or CLI and don’t specify a specific team. It will also be the team shown whenever you first log in to Vercel or navigate to /dashboard. The first Hobby or Pro team you create will automatically be nominated as the default team.
How to change your default team
If you delete, leave, or are removed from your default team, Vercel will automatically choose a new default team for you. However, you may want to choose a default team yourself. To do that:

Navigate to vercel.com/account/settings
Under Default Team, select your new default team from the dropdown
Press Save

Find your team ID
Your Team ID is a unique and unchangeable identifier that's automatically assigned when your team is created.
There are a couple of methods you can use to locate your Team ID:

Vercel API: Use the Vercel API to retrieve your Team ID
Dashboard: Find your Team ID directly from your team's Dashboard on Vercel:

Navigate to the following URL, replacing your_team_name_here with your actual team's name: https://vercel.com/teams/your_team_name_here/settings#team-id.
If you're unable to locate your Team ID using the URL method, follow these steps:
Open your team's dashboard and head over to the Settings tab
Choose General from the left-hand navigation
Scroll down to the Team ID section and your Team ID will be there ready for you to copy



Team email domain
Configuring a team email domain will permit users with a matching and verified email address to request access to your team without requiring an invitation. For example, if your team email domain is acme.com, a user with the email address john@acme.com will be able to request access to join your team.
This is useful if you would like employees, or those you work with, to request access to join your team instead of sending them an invitation.
To allow this feature, you must add the email domain to the Vercel Domains section. Given the example above, you would add acme.com.
Setting the Team Email Domain for a Team.
Managing emails
To access your email settings from the dashboard:

Select your avatar in the top right corner of the dashboard.
Select Account Settings from the list.
Select the Settings tab and scroll down to the Emails section.
You can then add, remove, or change the primary email address associated with your account.

Adding a new email address
To add a new email address

Follow the steps above and select the Add Another button in the Emails section of your account settings.
Once you have added the new email address, Vercel will send an email with a verification link to the newly added email. Follow the link in the email to verify your new email address.
Once verified, all email addresses can be used to log in to your account, including your primary email address.

You can add up to three emails per account, with a single email domain shared by two emails at most.
Your account email addresses.
Changing your primary email address
Your primary email address is the email address that will be used to send you notifications, such as when you receive a new preview comment or when you are invited to a team.
Once you have added and verified a new email address, you can change your primary email address by selecting Set as Primary in the dot menu.
Setting your primary email address.
Removing an email address
To remove an email address select the Delete button in the dot menu.
If you wish to remove your primary email address, you will need to set a new primary email address first.Last updated on March 17, 2025NextActivity LogWas this helpful?supported.SendOn this pageSign

The Activity Log provides a list of all events on a Hobby team or team, chronologically organized since its creation. These events include:

User(s) involved with the event
Type of event performed
Type of account
Time of the event (hover over the time to reveal the exact timestamp)

Vercel does not emit any logs to third-party services. The Activity Log is
only available to the account owner and team members.

Example events list on the Activity page.
When to use the Activity log
Common use cases for viewing the Activity log include:

If a user was removed or deleted by mistake, use the list to find when the event happened and who requested it
A domain can be disconnected from your deployment. Use the list to see if a domain related event was recently triggered
Check if a specific user was removed from a team

Configure fine-grained access control at the project level for different deployment environments.Deployment Protection safeguards both your preview and production URLs across various environments. Configured at the project level through your settings, Deployment Protection provides detailed access control for different deployment types.
Vercel offers the following Deployment Protection features:

Vercel Authentication: Restricts access to your deployments to only Vercel users with suitable access rights. Vercel Authentication is available on all plans
Password Protection: Restricts access to your deployments to only users with the correct password. Password Protection is available on the Enterprise plan, or as a paid add-on for Pro plans
Trusted IPs: Restricts access to your deployments to only users with the correct IP address. Trusted IPs is available on the Enterprise plan

Configuring Deployment Protection
Deployment Protection is managed through your project settings. To configure Deployment Protection:

From the dashboard, select the project you wish to set Deployment Protection on
Once selected, navigate to the Settings tab
From the list, select the Deployment Protection tab

Understanding Deployment Protection by environment
You can configure the type of Deployment Protection for each environment in your project depending on your projects security needs. When choosing your protection method, you can select from three options:

Standard Protection: Protects all preview URLs and production deployment URLs. All up to date production URLs are unprotected. Standard Protection is available on all plans
Only Preview Deployments: Protects only preview URLs. Protecting preview deployments is available on all plans
All Deployments: Protects all URLs. Protecting all deployments is available on Pro and Enterprise plans

To protect only production URLs, you can use Trusted IPs. Note that this option is only available on the Enterprise plan.
Protecting preview and generated URLs with Standard Protection
Standard Protection is available     on all plans
The Standard Protection option is the recommended way to secure all your domains, including both preview and production deployment URLs, to limit public access.
With Standard Protection selected, example.com serves as your publicly-accessible production domain, while all other generated URLs would be protected.
This means that any production deployment with a custom domain assigned (even if it is not the current production deployment) is unprotected. This includes alias URLs where the target of the deployment is production.
Selecting Standard Protection in the Vercel Dashboard.
Standard Protection can be configured with the following Deployment Protection features:

Vercel Authentication
Password Protection
Trusted IPs

Migrating to Standard Protection
Enabling Standard Protection restricts public access to the production generated deployment URL. This affects VERCEL_URL from System Environment Variables and VERCEL_URL from Framework Environment Variables, making them unsuitable for fetch requests.
If you are using VERCEL_URL to make fetch requests, you will need to update your requests to target the same domain the user has requested.
The Framework Environment Variable VERCEL_URL is prefixed with the name of
the framework. For example, VERCEL_URL for Next.js is
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL, and VERCEL_URL for Nuxt.js is
NUXT_ENV_VERCEL_URL. See the Framework Environment
Variables
documentation for more information.
For client-side requests, use relative paths in the fetch call to target the current domain, automatically including the user's authentication cookie for protected URLs.
// Before
fetch(`${process.env.VERCEL_URL}/some/path`);
 
// After
fetch('/some/path');
// Note: For operations requiring fully qualified URLs, such as generating OG images,
// replace '/some/path' with the actual domain (e.g. 'https://yourdomain.com/some/path').
For server-side requests, use the origin from the incoming request and manually add request cookies to pass the user's authentication cookie.
const headers = { cookie: <incoming request header cookies> };
fetch('<incoming request origin>/some/path', { headers });
Bypassing protection using Protection Bypass for Automation is an option but not required for requests targeting the same domain.
Protecting only preview deployments
Protecting preview deployments is available     on all plans
When Only Preview Deployments is selected, preview URLs are protected, while the production environment remains publicly accessible. This allows for secure testing and review.
For example, Vercel generates a preview URL such as my-preview-5678.vercel.app, which will be protected. In contrast, all production URLs, including example.com and any past or current generated production branch URLs like *-main.vercel.app, remain accessible.
Selecting Only Preview Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.
Protecting only preview deployments can be configured with the following Deployment Protection features:

Vercel Authentication
Password Protection
Trusted IPs

Protecting only production deployments
Protecting production deployments is available     on Enterprise plans
Use this option to restrict access to protection deployments to a list of Trusted IPs.
Preview deployment URLs remain publicly accessible. This feature is only available on the Enterprise plan.
Want to talk to our team?This feature is available on the Enterprise plan.Schedule Call
Selecting All Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.
Protect all deployments
Protecting all deployments is available     on Enterprise plans or with the Advanced Deployment Protection add-on for Pro plans
Selecting All Deployments secures all deployments, both preview and production, restricting public access entirely.
With this configuration, all URLs, including your production domain example.com and generated URLs like my-project-1234.vercel.app, are protected.
Selecting All Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.
Protecting all deployments can be configured with the following Deployment Protection features:

Vercel Authentication
Password Protection
Trusted IPs

Advanced Deployment Protection
Advanced Deployment Protection features are available to Enterprise customers by default. Customers on the Pro plan can access these features for an additional $150 per month, including:

Password Protection
Private Production Deployments
Deployment Protection Exceptions

Enabling Advanced Deployment Protection
To opt-into Advanced Deployment Protection while on a Pro plan:

Navigate to your Project Settings and select the Deployment Protection tab
Then choose one of the above protection features
You will then be prompted to upgrade to the Advanced Deployment Protection add-on through an Enable and Pay button before you can use the feature

When you enable Advanced Deployment Protection, you will be charged $150 per month for the add-on, and will have access to all Advanced Deployment Protection features.
Disabling Advanced Deployment Protection
To opt out of Advanced Deployment Protection:

Navigate to your Team Settings, then the Billing page
Press Edit on the feature you want to disable and follow the instructions to disable the add-on

In order to disable Advanced Deployment Protection, you must have been using the feature for a minimum of thirty days. After this time, once cancelled, all Advanced Deployment Protection features will be disabled.

Shareable Links: Shareable links enable external users to access specific branch deployments by appending a secure query parameter to the URL
Protection Bypass for Automation: Use a secret to bypass protection features for all deployments in a project, such as for end-to-end (E2E) testing
Deployment Protection Exceptions: Specify preview domains that should be exempt from deployment protection
OPTIONS Allowlist: Specify paths to be unprotected for CORS preflight OPTIONS requests

Sharable Links
Shareable Links are available     on all plans
Sharable Links allow external access to specific branch deployments through a secure query parameter. Users with this link can see the latest deployment and leave comments (if enabled and logged in with their Vercel account).
For example, if you generate a Sharable Link for the feature-new-ui branch. Users with this link can view the latest deployment and comment.
Learn more about Sharable Links, and how to generate and revoke them.
Protection bypass for Automation
Protection Bypass for Automation is available     on all plans
For automated tasks like end-to-end (E2E) testing, you can use Protection bypass for Automation. When enabled, it generates a secret that can be used as a System Environment Variable (VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET) to bypass protection features for all deployments in a project.
For example, you set up E2E tests that run on deployments. By using this feature and the generated secret, your tests can bypass the protection mechanisms.
Learn more about Protection bypass for Automation, and how to enable and disable it.
Deployment Protection Exceptions
Deployment Protection Exceptions are available     on Enterprise plans or with the Advanced Deployment Protection add-on for Pro plans
With Deployment Protection Exceptions you can specify preview domains that should be exempt from deployment protection. Adding a domain to Deployment Protection Exceptions makes it publicly accessible, bypassing features like Vercel Authentication, Password Protection, and Trusted IPs.
For example, if you add preview-branch-name.vercel.app to Deployment Protection Exceptions, this domain becomes publicly accessible, bypassing the project's deployment protection settings. When removed, it reverts to the default protection settings.
Learn more about Deployment Protection Exceptions, and how to add and remove domains.
OPTIONS Allowlist
OPTIONS Allowlist is available     on all plans
With OPTIONS Allowlist you can specify paths to be unprotected for preflight OPTIONS requests. This can be used to enable CORS preflight requests to your project's protected deployments, as browsers do not send authentication on preflight requests.
Incoming request paths will be compared with the paths in the allowlist, if a request path starts with one of the specified paths, and has the method OPTIONS, it will bypass Deployment Protection.
For example, if you specify /api, all requests to paths that start with /api (such as /api/v1/users and /api/v2/projects) will be unprotected for any OPTIONS request.
Learn more about OPTIONS Allowlist.

The Protection Bypass for Automation feature lets you bypass Vercel Deployment Protection (Password Protection, Vercel Authentication, and Trusted IPs) for automated tooling (e.g. E2E testing).
The generated secret can be used to bypass deployment protection on all deployments in a project until it is revoked. This value will also be automatically added to your deployments as a system environment variable VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET.
The environment variable value is set when a deployment is built, so regenerating the secret in the project settings will invalidate previous deployments. You will need to redeploy your app if you update the secret in order to use the new value.
Protection Bypass for Automation option
Who can manage protection bypass for automation?

Team members with at least the member role
Project members with the Project Administrator role

Using Protection Bypass for Automation
To use Protection Bypass for Automation, set an HTTP header (or query parameter) named x-vercel-protection-bypass with the value of the generated secret for the project.
Using a header is strongly recommended, however in cases where your automation tool is unable to specify a header, it is also possible to set the same name and value as a query parameter.
x-vercel-protection-bypass: your-generated-secret (required)
Advanced Configuration
To bypass authorization on follow-up requests (e.g. for in-browser testing) you can set an additional header or query parameter named x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie with the value true.
This will set the authorization bypass as a cookie using a redirect with a Set-Cookie header.
x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie: true (optional)
If you are accessing the deployment through a non-direct way (e.g. in an iframe) then you may need to further configure x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie by setting the value to samesitenone.
This will set SameSite to None on the Set-Cookie header, by default SameSite is set to Lax.
x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie: samesitenone (optional)

Project members with at least the Project Developer role


Production Domains:

Team members with at least the Member role
Project members with the Project Administrator role



Creating Sharable Links
Users with the Admin, Member, and Developer roles can create or revoke sharable links for their project's deployments. Personal accounts can also manage sharable links for their Hobby deployments.
Developers on the hobby plan can only create one shareable link in total per
account.
To manage Sharable Links, do the following:
Select your projectFrom your Vercel dashboard:
Select the project that you wish to enable Vercel Authentication for
Go to the Deployments tab
Select the deploymentFrom the list of Preview Deployments, select the deployment you wish to share.Click Share buttonFrom the Deployment page, click Share to display the Share popover. From the popover, select Anyone with the link from the dropdown.The Share settings modal.Revoking a Sharable LinkTo revoke access for users, switch the dropdown option to Only people with access.If you have also shared the deployment with individual users, you will need to remove them from the Share popover.

Depending on your use case, you can choose to protect a single environment, or multiple environments. See Understanding Deployment Protection by environment for more information.
You can see an overview of your projects' protections in the following way

From your dashboard go to the Settings tab
Select Deployment Protection

View your project protections on the Dashboard > Settings > Deployment Protection page.
Vercel Authentication
Vercel Authentication is available     on all plans
With Vercel Authentication you can restrict access to all deployments (including non-public deployments), meaning only those with a Vercel account on your team, or those you share a Sharable Link with, can access non-public urls, such as my-project-1234-your-name.vercel.app.
When a Vercel user visits your protected deployment, but they do not have permission to access it, they have the option to request access for their Vercel account. This request triggers an email and Vercel notification to the branch authors.
Learn more about Vercel Authentication and how to enable it.
Password Protection
Password Protection is available     on Enterprise plans or with the Advanced Deployment Protection add-on for Pro plans
Password Protection on Vercel lets you restrict access to both non-public, and public deployments depending on the type of environment protection you choose.
Learn more about Password Protection and how to enable it.
Trusted IPs
Trusted IPs are available     on Enterprise plans
Trusted IPs restrict deployment access to specified IPv4 addresses and CIDR ranges, returning a 404 for unauthorized IPs. This protection feature is suitable for limiting access through specific paths like VPNs or external proxies.
Learn more about Trusted IPs and how to enable it.

Password Protection security considerations
The table below outlines key considerations and security implications when using Password Protection for your deployments on Vercel.
ConsiderationDescriptionEnvironment ConfigurationCan be enabled for different environments. See Understanding Deployment Protection by environmentCompatibilityCompatible with Vercel Authentication and Trusted IPsBypass MethodsCan be bypassed using Shareable Links and Protection bypass for AutomationPassword PersistenceUsers only need to enter the password once per deployment, or when the password changes, due to cookie set by the feature being invalidated on password changePassword ChangesUsers must re-enter a new password if you change the existing oneDisabling ProtectionAll existing deployments become unprotected if you disable the featureToken ScopeJWT tokens set as cookies are valid only for the URL they were set for and can't be reused for different URLs, even if those URLs point to the same deployment
Managing Password Protection
You can manage Password Protection through the dashboard, API, or Terraform:
Go to Project Deployment Protection SettingsFrom your Vercel dashboard:
Select the project that you wish to enable Password Protection for
Go to Settings then Deployment Protection
Manage Password ProtectionFrom the Password Protection section:
Use the toggle to enable the feature
Select the deployment environment you want to protect
Enter a password of your choice
Finally, select Save
All your existing and future deployments will be protected with a password for the project. Next time when you access a deployment, you will be asked to log in by entering the password, which takes you to the deployment. A cookie will then be set in your browser for the deployment URL so you don't need to enter the password every time.Enabling Password Protection.
Manage using the API
You can manage Password Protection using the Vercel API endpoint to update an existing project with the following body

deploymentType

Vercel Authentication lets you restrict access to your public and non-public deployments. It is the recommended approach to protecting your deployments, and available on all plans. When enabled, it allows only users with deployment access to view and comment on your site.
Users attempting to access the deployment will encounter a Vercel login redirect. If already logged into Vercel, Vercel will authenticate them automatically.
After login, users are redirected and a cookie is set in the browser if they have view access. If the user does not have access to view the deployment, they will be redirected to request access.
Who can access protected deployments?

Logged in team members with at least the viewer role
Logged in project members with at least the project Viewer role
Logged in members of an access group that has access to the project the deployment belongs to
Logged in Vercel users who have been granted access
Anyone who has been given a Shareable Link to the deployment
Tools using the protection bypass for automation header

Access requests
Access requests are available     on all plansThose with the owner, member, admin and developer roles can accept or reject access requests
When a Vercel user visits your protected deployment, but they do not have permission to access it, they have the option to request access for their Vercel account.
This request triggers an email and Vercel notification to the branch authors.
External users can request access to protected deployments.
The access request can be approved or declined. Additionally, granted access can be revoked for a user at any time.
Users granted access can view the latest deployment from a specific branch when logged in with their Vercel account.
They can also leave preview Comments if these are enabled on your team.
Those on the Hobby plan can only have one external user per account. If you need more, you can upgrade to a Pro plan.
You can manage access requests in the following way

From your dashboard go to the Settings tab
Select Deployment Protection and then choose the Requests tab to see pending requests
Choose Access to manage existing access

Access requests can be approved and declined on the Dashboard > Settings > Deployment Protection > Requests section.
Granted access requests can be managed on the Dashboard > Settings > Deployment Protection > Access section.
Access requests can also be managed using the share modal on the deployment page
Access requests can be approved, declined and revoked in the deployment share modal.
Vercel Authentication security considerations
You can configure Vercel Authentication for different environments, as outlined in Understanding Deployment Protection by environment. This feature works alongside other security measures like Password Protection and Trusted IPs. For specific use-cases, you can bypass Vercel Authentication with methods like Shareable Links or Protection bypass for Automation.
Disabling Vercel Authentication renders all existing deployments unprotected. However, re-enabling it allows previously authenticated users to maintain access without a new login provided they have already authenticated to the specific deployment and have a cookie set in their browser. The authentication token sent as a cookie is restricted to one URL and isn't transferable, even between URLs pointing to the same deployment.

See Understanding Deployment Protection by environmentCompatibilityCompatible with Password Protection and Trusted IPsBypass MethodsCan be bypassed using Shareable Links and Protection bypass for AutomationDisablingAll existing deployments become unprotected when Vercel Authentication is disabledRe-enablingUsers who have logged in previously will still have access without re-authenticatingToken ScopeTokens are valid for a single URL and are not reusable across different URLs
Managing Vercel Authentication
Admins and members can enable or disable Vercel Authentication for their team. Hobby teams can also enable or disable for their own projects. Vercel Authentication is managed on a per-project basis.
You can manage Vercel Authentication through the dashboard, API, or Terraform:
Manage using the dashboard
Go to Project Deployment Protection SettingsFrom your Vercel dashboard:
Select the project that you wish to enable Password Protection for
Go to Settings then Deployment Protection
Manage Vercel AuthenticationFrom the Vercel Authentication section:
Use the toggle to enable the feature
Select the deployment environment you want to protect
Finally, Select Save
All your existing and future deployments will be protected with Vercel Authentication for the project. Next time when you access a deployment, you will be asked to log in with Vercel if you aren't already logged in, you will be redirected to the deployment URL and a cookie will be set in your browser for that deployment URL.Enabling Vercel Authentication.
Manage using the API
You can manage Vercel Authentication using the Vercel API endpoint to update an existing project with the following body

prod_deployment_urls_and_all_previews: Standard Protection
all: All Deployments
preview: Only Preview Deployments

// enable / update Vercel Authentication
{
  "ssoProtection": {
    "deploymentType": "prod_deployment_urls_and_all_previews" | "all" | "preview"
  }
}
 
// disable Vercel Authentication
{
  "ssoProtection": null
}
Manage using Terraform
You can configure Vercel Authentication using vercel_authentication in the vercel_project data source in the Vercel Terraform Provider.Last updated on March 4, 2025NextAccount ManagementWas this

Directory Sync helps teams manage their organization membership from a third-party identity provider like Google Directory or Okta. Like SAML, Directory Sync is only available for Enterprise Teams and can only be configured by Team Owners.
When Directory Sync is configured, changes to your Directory Provider will automatically be synced with your team members. The previously existing permissions/roles will be overwritten by Directory Sync, including current user performing the sync.
Make sure that you still have the right permissions/role after configuring
Directory Sync, otherwise you might lock yourself
out.
All team members will receive an email detailing the change. For example, if a new user is added to your Okta directory, that user will automatically be invited to join your Vercel Team. If a user is removed, they will automatically be removed from the Vercel Team.
You can configure a mapping between your Directory Provider's groups and a Vercel Team role. For example, your Engineers group on Okta can be configured with the member role on Vercel, and your Admin group can use the owner role.
Configuring Directory Sync
To configure directory sync for your team:

Ensure your team is selected in the scope selector
From your team's dashboard, select the Settings tab, and then Security & Privacy
Under SAML Single Sign-On, select the Configure button. This opens a dialog to guide you through configuring Directory Sync for your Team with your Directory Provider.
Once you have completed the configuration walkthrough, configure how Directory Groups should map to Vercel Team roles:
Setting the Okta Admins group as Vercel owners and the Engineers group as Vercel Members.

Finally, an overview of all synced members is shown. Click Confirm and Sync to complete the syncing:
An overview of Team owners and Members that will be added.

Once confirmed, Directory Sync will be successfully configured for your Vercel Team.

SAML Single Sign-On is optionally available on the Enterprise Plan. To enable
contact sales.
Supported providers
See SAML Single Sign-On for a list of all the SAML providers that Vercel supports.
Preventing account lockout
To prevent account lockout ensure that at least one person in your team has the owner role, and that they are not removed from the team.
If access is lost due to removal of team owners, use the following group names to automatically allocate the corresponding roles to individuals in that group:

To manage the members of your team through a third-party identity provider like Okta or Auth0, you can set up the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) feature from your team's settings.
Once enabled, all team members will be able to log in, or access Preview and Production Deployments, using your selected identity provider and, similar to the team email domain feature, any new users signing up with SAML will automatically be added to your team.
If needed, you can also automatically assign a users Hobby team with a specific role within your team by setting up Directory Sync.
The SAML SSO settings for a Team.
Configuring SAML SSO

To configure SAML SSO for your team, you must be an owner of the team
From your dashboard, ensure your team is selected in the scope selector
Navigate to the Settings tab and select Security & Privacy
Navigate to the SAML Single Sign-On section. Click Configure and follow the walkthrough to configure SAML SSO for your team with your identity provider of choice
As a further step, you may want to enforce SAML SSO for your team

Want to talk to our team?This feature is available on the Enterprise plan.Schedule Call
Enforcing SAML
For additional security, SAML SSO can be enforced for a team so that all team members cannot access any team information unless their current session was authenticated with SAML SSO.

To enforce SAML SSO for your team, you must be an owner and currently be authenticated with SAML SSO. This ensures that your configuration is working properly before tightening access to your team information
From your dashboard, navigate to the Settings tab and select Security & Privacy. Then go to the SAML Single Sign-On section
Toggle the Require Team Members to login with SAML switch to Enabled

SAML SSO configured and enforced.
When modifying your SAML configuration, the option for enforcing will
automatically be turned off. Please verify your new configuration is working
correctly by re-authenticating with SAML SSO before re-enabling the option.
Authenticating with SAML SSO
Once you have configured SAML, your team members can use SAML SSO to log in or sign up to Vercel. To login:

Select the Continue with SAML SSO button on the authentication page, then enter your team's URL.
Your team slug is the identifier in the URLs for your team. For example, the identifier for vercel.com/acme is acme.
Select Continue with SAML SSO again to be redirected to the third-party authentication provider to finish authenticating. Once completed, you will be logged into Vercel.

SAML SSO sessions last for 24 hours before users must re-authenticate with the third-party SAML provider (unless Directory Sync is configured).
Customizing the login page
You can choose to share a Vercel login page that only shows the option to log in with SAML SSO. This prevents your team members from logging in with an account that's not managed by your identity provider.
To use this page, you can set the saml query param to your team URL. For example:
https://vercel.com/login?saml=team_id
Vercel's login page showing only the SAML SSO login button.
De-provisioning team members
Vercel is SCIM compliant and therefore when a user is removed from your SAML provider, they are automatically offboarded from Vercel.
SAML providers
Vercel supports the following third-party SAML providers:

Okta
Auth0
Google
Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure Active Directory)
Microsoft ADFS

Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.
The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.
Generating text
At the center of the AI SDK is AI SDK Core, which provides a unified API to call any LLM.
The following example shows how to generate text with the AI SDK using OpenAI's GPT-4o:
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
 
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  prompt: 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
});
The unified interface means that you can easily switch between providers by changing just two lines of code. For example, to use Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.7:
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
 
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219'),
  prompt: 'How many people will live in the world in 2040?',
});
Generating structured data
While text generation can be useful, you might want to generate structured JSON data. For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data. AI SDK Core provides two functions (generateObject and streamObject) to generate structured data, allowing you to constrain model outputs to a specific schema.
The following example shows how to generate a type-safe recipe that conforms to a zod schema:
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';
 
const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
Using tools with the AI SDK
The AI SDK supports tool calling out of the box, allowing it to interact with external systems and perform discrete tasks. The following example shows how to use tool calling with the AI SDK:
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
 
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  prompt: 'What is the weather like today in San Francisco?',
  tools: {
    getWeather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
});
Getting started with the AI SDK
The AI SDK is available as a package. To install it, run the following command:
pnpmyarnnpmbun pnpm i ai
See the AI SDK Getting Started guide for more information on how to get started with the AI SDK.

Exploring models
To explore models:

Use the search bar, provider select, or type filter to find the model you want to add
Select the model you want to add by pressing the Explore button
The model playground will open, and you can test the model before adding it to your project

Using the model playground
The model playground lets you test the model you are interested in before adding it to your project. If you have not installed an AI provider through the Vercel dashboard, then you will have ten lifetime generations per provider (they do not refresh, and once used, are spent) regardless of plan. If you have installed an AI provider that supports the model, Vercel will use your provider key.
You can use the model playground to test the model's capabilities and see if it fits your projects needs.
The model playground differs depending on the model you are testing. For example, if you are testing a chat model, you can input a prompt and see the model's response. If you are testing an image model, you can upload an image and see the model's output. Each model may have different variations based on the provider you choose.
The playground also lets you also configure the model's settings, such as temperature, maximum output length, duration, continuation, top p, and more. These settings and inputs are specific to the model you are testing.
Adding a model to your project
Once you have decided on the model you want to add to your project:

Select the Add Model button
If you have more than one provider that supports the model you are adding, you will be prompted to select the provider you want to use. To select a provider, press the Add Provider button next to the provider you want to use for the model
Review the provider card which displays the models available, along with a description of the provider and links to their website, pricing, and documentation and select the Add Provider button
You can now select which projects the provider will have access to. You can choose from All Projects or Specific Projects

If you select Specific Projects, you'll be prompted to select the projects you want to connect to the provider. The list will display projects associated with your scoped team
Multiple projects can be selected during this step


You'll be redirected to the provider's website to complete the connection process
Once the connection is complete, you'll be redirected back to the Vercel dashboard, and the provider integration dashboard page. From here you can manage your provider and model settings, view usage, and more
