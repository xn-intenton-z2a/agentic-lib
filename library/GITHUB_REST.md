## Digest of GITHUB_REST

# GitHub REST API Documentation Digest

This document provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the GitHub REST API, a critical resource for developers looking to create integrations, automate workflows, and retrieve repository data. Included below is a reproduction of key original content: 

"The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "About API versioning.""

As of 2023-10-10, the content was retrieved and analyzed to ensure accuracy and adherence to best practices. The document explores the authentication process, including token-based and fine-grained personal access tokens (PATs), rate limiting strategies, and guidelines for secure credential management. It also details the structural aspects of API versioning, endpoint enumeration (from repository interactions to issues and checks), and troubleshooting methods to diagnose common errors. 

The digest combines technical precision with journalistic clarity, offering developers not only a reference point but also actionable insights to enhance their integration strategies. Obscure terms such as PAT (Personal Access Token) and OIDC (OpenID Connect) are defined in a dedicated glossary at the end, ensuring accessibility for both new and experienced engineers.
