# Objective and Scope
This feature consolidates the duplicate implementations of the agentic command handler across the repository. Currently, there are two implementations found in src/lib/main.js and engineer-sandbox/source/main.js. The goal is to merge these into a single, unified implementation to reduce maintenance overhead and ensure consistent behavior across all CLI invocations.

# Implementation Details
- Identify the common functionalities in both agenticHandler implementations such as command validation, trimming, alias substitution, and performance metric recording.
- Refactor the duplicate logic so that one canonical implementation is maintained in src/lib/main.js. The duplicate implementation in engineer-sandbox/source/main.js should be updated to include a deprecation notice in a header comment directing future invocations to use the primary source file.
- Update documentation (README.md and inline comments) to clarify that the unified agenticHandler is now the single source of truth for processing commands.
- Update test files as necessary to reference and validate the behavior of the unified implementation, ensuring that all agentic command processing (including batch processing and metric aggregation) remains consistent.
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing CLI invocations using the --agentic flag.

# Success Criteria
- There is a single, well-documented implementation of agenticHandler that is referenced throughout the repository.
- The duplicate handler in engineer-sandbox/source/main.js clearly indicates that it is deprecated.
- Test coverage demonstrates that both single command and batch commands are processed correctly using the unified logic.
- Documentation updates in the README and contributing guidelines guide developers to focus on the canonical implementation.

# User Impact
Developers will benefit from reduced code duplication and streamlined maintenance. Consistent behavior in command processing and performance metric reporting will enhance debugging and ensure higher reliability when changes are made.
