# CLI_PARSER

## Objective and Scope
The CLI_PARSER feature ensures that the command line interface of agentic-lib robustly parses and validates all user-supplied arguments. This update extends its capability by including enhanced handling for numeric inputs and new flags such as --perf-metrics, --simulate-load, and --simulate-delay. In addition, the parser will now provide clear and detailed error messages in cases of malformed input. This update is designed to enforce strict input normalization while delivering aggregated performance metrics when requested, all in alignment with our mission for reliable, agentic operation.

## Implementation Details
- Update the main CLI processing in src/lib/main.js to incorporate enhanced validation for numeric flags using Zod or custom validators. Validate that numeric inputs (e.g., for --simulate-delay and --simulate-load) are positive numbers within acceptable ranges.
- Integrate processing for the --perf-metrics flag which, when invoked, aggregates performance statistics including total commands processed, average, minimum, maximum, median execution times, standard deviation, and 90th percentile times. This output should be formatted in JSON with an option to include additional metrics such as global call count and uptime when verbose stats are enabled.
- Normalize and trim all string inputs to avoid anomalies (e.g., case variations and extraneous whitespace), ensuring that non-actionable inputs (like empty strings or 'NaN') are properly rejected with descriptive error messages.
- Enhance the CLI help text and diagnostics output to include detailed instructions and examples for the new flags, clearly outlining the behavior of performance metrics and load simulation functionalities. Update the README and relevant documentation (e.g., docs/perf-metrics.md) to reflect these changes.
- Update existing unit tests and add new ones in the test files to cover scenarios including correct handling of numeric flags, validation of JSON payload inputs, and proper execution of the --perf-metrics flag. Tests should confirm that invalid input produces clear, actionable error messages.

## Success Criteria
- All CLI flags including --agentic, --simulate-delay, --simulate-load, --simulate-error, --apply-fix, --cli-utils, --workflow-chain, and --perf-metrics are parsed and validated correctly.
- Numeric inputs are strictly enforced, and users receive precise error messages when invalid values are provided.
- Invoking --perf-metrics outputs a complete JSON object containing detailed performance metrics that match the documentation.
- Updated test coverage verifies both the positive and negative cases of the CLI parsing improvements, ensuring backward compatibility for existing flags.

## User Impact
- Provides a seamless command line experience with consistent behavior and robust error messages.
- Empowers users to gather detailed performance insights, enhancing transparency and troubleshooting capabilities.
- Reduces the likelihood of runtime errors due to malformed inputs, thus improving overall system reliability and user satisfaction.
