# CLI_PARSER

## Objective and Scope
The goal of this feature is to enhance the command line argument parsing in the main source file using the Zod library. This involves robust validation and normalization of CLI flags, JSON payloads, and numeric inputs. It ensures that each invocation of the agentic-lib command line interface receives well-structured and type-checked arguments for improved error reporting and user guidance.

## Implementation Details
- Update src/lib/main.js to incorporate a dedicated CLI argument parsing routine that leverages Zod schemas.
- Create Zod schemas to validate the structure of JSON payloads passed to the --agentic flag, and to ensure numeric inputs for flags such as --simulate-delay and --simulate-load are valid and within acceptable ranges.
- Normalize command line inputs by trimming whitespace and handling common input anomalies (e.g., case variations for non-actionable inputs like NaN).
- When validation fails, output descriptive error messages to guide users on proper usage.
- Enhance existing unit tests and add new tests to cover various CLI input scenarios including missing values, malformed JSON, and invalid numeric inputs.
- Update the README to include usage examples and documentation for the new CLI argument parsing rules.

## Success Criteria
- All CLI flags and associated values pass through Zod-based validation before further processing.
- Users are provided with clear and concise error messages for invalid or missing arguments.
- Unit tests ensure that both valid and malformed inputs are handled gracefully, with expected outputs and error responses.
- Documentation reflects the new CLI parsing capabilities and offers guidance for proper command line usage.
