# INPUT_VALIDATION

This feature introduces robust input validation in the main source file using the Zod library. The goal is to ensure that every command or batch of commands provided to the agenticHandler is checked against a defined schema. This validation will help prevent processing of malformed or non-actionable inputs and provide clear error messages.

## Objective and Scope

The feature will integrate Zod-based schemas into the main.js file. The schemas will validate the structure of incoming commands, ensuring that the payloads contain the required fields, such as a single command or an array of commands. Clear error messages will be returned if the payload does not match the expected structure.

## Implementation Details

- Update the source file (src/lib/main.js) to define Zod schemas for single and batch command payloads.
- Use Zod's safeParse functionality to validate each input. If validation fails, return a comprehensive error message detailing the issues.
- Enhance the command processing workflow to use the validated, parsed data, ensuring that the full command specification is respected.
- Modify the test files to include unit tests that cover valid inputs, malformed inputs, and edge cases.
- Update the README to document the input validation rules, usage examples, and the error message format.

## Success Criteria

- All incoming command payloads are validated against the Zod schemas before processing.
- The system immediately rejects invalid or non-actionable inputs with clear and descriptive error outputs.
- Unit tests pass for both proper validation of correct inputs and proper rejection of malformed inputs.
- The README includes a detailed section on data validation and error handling.

## Dependencies

The feature leverages the existing Zod dependency. No new dependencies are required.

## User Impact

Users benefit from more robust error checking and a clearer understanding of why certain inputs are rejected. This improves the overall reliability of automated workflows and reduces debugging time when commands fail at the very start of processing.
