# ENHANCED_CLI

## Objective and Scope
This feature consolidates several CLI related improvements into a cohesive enhancement of the command line interface. It merges the functionality from output mode selection, alias logging, and input validation into one unified behavior. Users can now choose between JSON and text outputs, benefit from detailed alias substitution logs in verbose mode, and experience robust input validation via Zod schemas.

## Implementation Details
- Modify the main CLI processing in the source file to accept an additional flag --output-mode with valid values (json, text). The default remains JSON to ensure backward compatibility.
- Integrate output formatting functionality so that all command responses are conditionally output as human-readable plain text or standard JSON, based on the flag setting.
- Enhance the alias substitution mechanism so that when a command alias is applied (as defined in the COMMAND_ALIASES environment variable) and verbose mode is active, an informational log entry is added detailing the original command and its alias replacement.
- Introduce robust input validation in the main handler using Zod. Define schemas for both single-command and batch command payloads to ensure that each command is a valid non-empty string and not equivalent to 'NaN'. Provide clear error messages when validation fails.
- Update tests to reflect consolidated behavior and verify that:
   - The --output-mode flag correctly switches output formatting.
   - Alias substitution events are logged appropriately in verbose mode.
   - Invalid command inputs are properly rejected with descriptive errors.
- Update the CLI help instructions and README documentation to detail the new consolidated functionality for output mode, alias logging, and input validation.

## Success Criteria
- Users can invoke the CLI with the --output-mode flag to receive either JSON or plain text output.
- When a command alias is substituted, a log entry is created in verbose mode showing the mapping from the original command to its alias.
- All input commands are validated using defined Zod schemas, with malformed inputs rejected and informative error messages provided.
- Unit tests validate the combined effects, ensuring backward compatibility with existing flags and clear error handling.

## User Impact
Users gain a more robust and flexible CLI experience with enhanced readability, better error handling, and improved debugging support through detailed logging of alias substitutions.
