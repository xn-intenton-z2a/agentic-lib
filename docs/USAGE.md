# Usage Instructions for agentic-lib CLI

This document provides clear and concise usage details for the agentic-lib command line interface.

## Available Commands

- **--help**: Show help message and usage instructions.
- **--digest**: Run a sample SQS event simulation.
- **--agentic <jsonPayload>**: Process an agentic command using a JSON payload. The payload can contain either a single command (using the `command` property) or multiple commands (using a `commands` array for batch processing). Each valid command increments an internal counter and returns its execution time in milliseconds.

  **Batch Processing Note:** When a payload contains a `commands` array, the response will include a new property called `batchSummary`. This object contains:
  - `totalCommands`: the total number of commands processed
  - `totalExecutionTimeMS`: the total time in milliseconds taken to process the batch

- **--version**: Display version information from package.json along with the current timestamp.
- **--verbose**: Enable detailed logging for debugging purposes.
- **--diagnostics**: Output detailed diagnostics, including configuration and environment details.
- **--status**: Display a runtime health summary in JSON format.
- **--dry-run**: Execute a dry run without performing any actions.
- **--simulate-error**: Simulate an error scenario for testing purposes by immediately logging a simulated error and exiting with a non-zero status code.
- **--simulate-delay <ms>**: Simulate processing delay for the specified duration in milliseconds.
- **--simulate-load <ms>**: Simulate a heavy processing load by executing a CPUâ€‘intensive loop for the specified duration in milliseconds.
- **--apply-fix**: Apply automated fix and log a success message indicating that the fix was applied.
- **--cli-utils**: Displays a comprehensive summary of all CLI commands available along with brief descriptions.
- **--workflow-chain <jsonPayload>**: Process a chain of workflow commands sequentially. (Payload must have a `chain` array property)
- **--verbose-stats**: When used with a valid command, outputs additional runtime statistics in JSON format, including `callCount` (the number of successful command invocations) and `uptime` (the process uptime in seconds).

## Environment Variables

The CLI behavior can be customized using the following environment variables:

- **MAX_BATCH_COMMANDS**: Set this variable to limit the maximum number of commands that can be processed in a batch. If the number of commands exceeds this limit, the batch will be rejected with an error.
- **COMMAND_ALIASES**: Provide a JSON string mapping aliases to full command strings. For example, setting `COMMAND_ALIASES='{"ls": "list", "rm": "remove"}'` will automatically substitute any occurrence of the alias with its corresponding command.

## Enhanced Workflow Chain: Robust Chaining with Error Handling and Conditional Branching

A new function, `chainWorkflows`, has been introduced to provide more robust control when executing a sequence of workflow steps. Each step is an object that must include at least a `command` property and can optionally include a `haltOnFailure` flag (defaults to `true`).

- **Behavior:**
  - Each step is executed sequentially by invoking the underlying `agenticHandler`.
  - If a step fails and `haltOnFailure` is `true`, the chain is halted immediately.
  - If `haltOnFailure` is `false`, the chain continues executing subsequent steps even if a step fails.
  - Execution details for each step (status, execution time, and any error messages) are logged and aggregated.

- **Return Value:**
  The function returns an object containing:
  - `overallStatus`: "success", "failed", or "partial" depending on the execution outcomes.
  - `totalSteps`: the number of steps processed.
  - `totalExecutionTimeMS`: the total time taken for the chain execution.
  - `results`: an array with the outcome of each step.

- **Usage Example (Programmatic):**

```js
import { chainWorkflows } from 'agentic-lib';

const steps = [
  { command: 'build', haltOnFailure: false },
  { command: 'test' }, // defaults to haltOnFailure: true
  { command: 'deploy', haltOnFailure: false }
];

chainWorkflows(steps)
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

In the above example, if the second step fails, the chain halts because the default `haltOnFailure` is `true`. If you want the chain to continue despite failures, set `haltOnFailure` to `false` in the step object.
