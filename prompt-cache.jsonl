Dynamic configuration with auto-reload support via a configuration file, enabling seamless live updates.\\\\n// - Integrated error reporting via axios with a fallback to local logging if external reporting fails.\\\\n// - Internationalized enhanced logging and comprehensive error tracing.\\\\n// - Improved testing support including multi-file update capabilities, real-time test demos, and enhanced test validations.\\\\n// - Seamless API integrations with dynamic plugin loading, real-time error notifications, and an enhanced automatic retry mechanism on failures.\\\\n// - Efficient caching mechanisms for optimized performance with global cache management and dynamic cache clearing.\\\\n// - Real-time collaboration support with session management.\\\\n// - Robust modular plugin system with live monitoring of the plugins directory and automatic reloading of plugins.\\\\n// - Comprehensive pull request and issue management utilities with automated labeling and merging.\\\\n// - Supports multi-file updates across source, test, and configuration files.\\\\n// - Advanced reload capabilities that dynamically reload all agentic features including configuration, plugins, and cache.\\\\n// - Automatic state backup and recovery functionality that periodically saves the current state and enables recovery on failures.\\\\n\\\\nimport { fileURLToPath } from \\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { randomInt } from \\\\\\\"crypto\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { OpenAI } from \\\\\\\"openai\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { z } from \\\\\\\"zod\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport axios from \\\\\\\"axios\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport fs from \\\\\\\"fs\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { setTimeout as delayPromise } from 'timers/promises';\\\\n\\\\n// ------------------ Utility Functions ------------------\\\\n\\\\n// Translates a message to a target language (simulation)\\\\nfunction translateMessage(message, targetLang) {\\\\n  return `[${targetLang}] ${message}`;\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n// Logger function for extended logging support with internationalization\\\\nfunction logger(message, level = \\\\\\\"info\\\\\\\") {\\\\n  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();\\\\n  const language = (global.config && global.config.language) || \\\\\\\"en_US\\\\\\\";\\\\n  const logMessage = language !== \\\\\\\"en_US\\\\\\\" ? translateMessage(message, language) : message;\\\\n  console.log(`[${level.toUpperCase()}] ${timestamp} -
