Dev transformed FizzBuzz (12 files) but **push failed** — concurrent schedule workflow modified `agentic-lib-workflow.yml` which got included in commit, triggering GitHub App `workflows` permission error. Operator error, not pipeline bug. Safety check blocked writing to `tests/behaviour/fizzbuzz.spec.js` (path-writable restriction working). |

## Findings

### FINDING-1: Mission-complete declaration works (POSITIVE — regression from Report 003 fixed)

The supervisor declared `mission-complete` on iteration 5, with clear reasoning: "0 open issues, 2+ recent issues closed by review as RESOLVED, src/lib/main.js exports fizzBuzz and fizzBuzzSingle with edge-case handling; tests and README were added per resolved issues."

This is the first time mission-complete has been declared via the supervisor path since the Copilot SDK migration. In Report 001, it was declared by the transform agent writing MISSION_COMPLETE.md. In Reports 002 and 003, it was never declared.

**Root cause of fix**: W4 added mission-complete readiness narrative to the intentïon.md log, making the metrics visible to the supervisor LLM. The supervisor needed 2 idle rounds (iterations 3-4) with issues being closed by review before it triggered.

### FINDING-2: Review-features acts as effective quality gate (NEW — POSITIVE)

The `review-features` job now correctly detects when newly-created issues are already resolved by the existing codebase. On iterations 3 and 4, the supervisor created enhancement issues, and review-features used the Copilot SDK to verify the code already satisfies them, closing them immediately.

This creates a clean convergence pattern:
1. Supervisor creates issue → review-features closes it as resolved
2. Dev finds no open issue → skips
3. After 2+ rounds of this, supervisor declares mission-complete

### FINDING-3: Function naming is correct (POSITIVE — regression from Report 003 fixed)

The transform produced `fizzBuzz()` and `fizzBuzzSingle()` — exactly matching the mission spec. In Report 003, this same mission produced no code in main.js (S1), and the hamming-distance mission (S3) used `hamming()` instead of `hammingDistance()`.

**Likely cause**: The `recommended` profile provides `max-source-chars=5000` (vs `min`'s 1000), giving the LLM more context from the mission spec to get function names right.

### FINDING-4: Dedup guard respects init timestamp (POSITIVE — W2 verified)

Issue #2746 was created cleanly after init, despite old issues (#2737, #2740, #2743) existing from prior runs. The init at 02:05 UTC set the timestamp, and the dedup guard correctly excluded issues closed before that timestamp.

Compare with Report 003 S2, where the dedup guard blocked all issue creation because of closed issues from S1.

### FINDING-5: Profile=unknown still logged (CONCERN — W7 not fully fixed)

Tuning logs still show `profile=unknown`:
```
[tuning] reasoningEffort=medium profile=unknown model=gpt-5-mini
```

The profile values ARE correct (medium reasoning, 5000 source chars, 10 source files — all `recommended` values), but the log label is wrong. This was W7 in the fix plan, marked as "done (already implemented)" but clearly not resolved.

### FINDING-6: MISSION_COMPLETE.md not persisted to repository (CONCERN)

The supervisor declared mission-complete and the log says "Mission complete signal written," but MISSION_COMPLETE.md was not committed to the repository. The file was written locally on the runner's filesystem during the supervisor job, but the supervisor job has no commit step. The signal exists only as a workflow output, not as a persistent file.

**Impact**: If another workflow run is dispatched, the dev job checks `if [ -f MISSION_COMPLETE.md ]` which will fail (file not on main). The mission-complete state is not durable across runs.

### FINDING-7: Repeated "mission started" discussion posts (BUG)

The maintain job's narrative thread posted "New mission started!" to [Discussion #2745](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/discussions/2745) on every iteration (4 times). Only the first post-init iteration should announce mission start. The final post correctly said "the implementation appears to meet the acceptance criteria."

**Root cause** (in `src/actions/agentic-step/tasks/supervise.js` lines 716-727):
1. The "first run after init" guard checks `a.name === "agentic-lib-workflow"` but the GitHub API returns `"agentic-lib-workflow [main]"` (with branch suffix from `run-name`). The exact-match **never matches**, so `supervisorRunCount` is always 0.
2. The fallback check `ctx.recentActivity.includes("supervised:")` fails because the supervisor job has **no commit step** — the intentïon.md log is written locally on the runner but never pushed. On the next run, a fresh checkout has no record.
3. Both guards always evaluate to `false`, so `hasPriorSupervisor` is always `false` and every run announces "New mission started!"

### FINDING-8: web.test.js fails on missing jsdom (CONCERN)

Every iteration's post-commit-test fails with:
```
Error: Cannot find package 'jsdom' imported from tests/unit/web.test.js
```

The transform modified `web.test.js` (13 additions, 24 deletions per PR #2747) but introduced an `import` of `jsdom` which isn't in package.json dependencies. This causes the post-commit unit test job to fail on every run.

**Impact**: The workflow overall is marked as failed (X) even though the transform and behaviour tests succeed. This could confuse the fix-stuck job or the supervisor.

### FINDING-9: Safety check correctly blocks out-of-scope file writes (POSITIVE — NEW)

The path-writable safety check blocked writes to `tests/behaviour/fizzbuzz.spec.js` because that path wasn't in the `writable-paths` input. The LLM attempted to write behaviour tests but the safety check prevented it, limiting the transform to the approved paths (`src/lib/`, `tests/unit/`, `docs/`, etc.).

This is the first benchmark to observe the safety check working correctly.

## Comparison with Previous Reports

| Metric | Report 001 (fizz-buzz/rec) | Report 003 S1 (fizz-buzz/min) | This Report (fizz-buzz/rec) |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| agentic-lib version | 7.1.76 | 7.1.91 | 7.1.97 |
| Profile | recommended | min | recommended |
| Model | gpt-5-mini | gpt-5-mini | gpt-5-mini |
| Time to working code | ~9 min | Never (docs only) | ~19 min |
| Transforms | 1 | 1 (docs only) | 1 |
| Function names correct | YES | N/A | YES |
| Mission complete declared | YES (28 min) | NO | **YES (40 min)** |
| Acceptance criteria met | 8/8 | 1/8 | **8/8** |
| Dedup blocked | No | No (but blocked S2) | No (W2 fix working) |
| Behaviour test blocker | No | YES (fixed in v7.1.91) | No |
| Safety check working | Not tested | Not tested | **YES** |

**Key observations:**

1. **Mission-complete works again** — after being broken in Reports 002 and 003, the supervisor now declares mission-complete via the Copilot SDK path. The fix (W4 — mission readiness narrative in intentïon.md) gives the LLM the signals it needs to make the decision.

2. **`recommended` > `min` for fizz-buzz** — The `recommended` profile succeeded completely (8/8 criteria, correct function names, mission-complete) while `min` failed on the same mission in Report 003 (1/8, docs only, no mission-complete).

3. **Review-features is the new quality gate** — Instead of relying on the supervisor to stop creating issues, the review-features job now validates and closes issues that are already resolved. This is a healthy convergence mechanism.

4. **Iteration 1 push failure was operator error** — Running the schedule workflow concurrently with the first iteration caused a workflow file to be included in the commit. Not a pipeline bug.

5. **Slower than Report 001** — 40 min vs 28 min for mission-complete, and 19 min vs 9 min for working code. Report 001 used the transform-agent path (pre-Copilot SDK) which was faster but less robust.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Fix MISSION_COMPLETE.md persistence** (HIGH) — The supervisor's `mission-complete` action writes the file locally but doesn't commit it. Either add a commit step to the supervisor job, or have the `mission-complete` action handler push a commit via the GitHub API (similar to issue creation).

2. **Fix repeated "mission started" posts** (MEDIUM) — The maintain job's narrative thread should only post "New mission started!" on the first iteration after init. Check if the discussion already has a "mission started" post more recent than the init timestamp before posting.

3. **Fix web.test.js jsdom dependency** (MEDIUM) — The transform introduced a `jsdom` import to `web.test.js` without adding it to package.json. Either the seed `web.test.js` should avoid jsdom, or the transform agent should be instructed not to modify `web.test.js`, or jsdom should be a dev dependency.

4. **Fix profile=unknown log label** (LOW) — W7 was marked done but still shows `profile=unknown`. The profile name resolution in the agentic-step action needs investigation.

5. **Consider reducing convergence time** (LOW) — 3 idle iterations (3→5) before mission-complete seems excessive. The supervisor could potentially declare mission-complete after 1 idle round if review-features has closed issues as RESOLVED, rather than waiting for 2+.

6. **Run S2 (fizz-buzz / gpt-5-mini / recommended, budget 32) for repeatability** (LOW) — This report is a single run. Running the same scenario again would validate consistency.
