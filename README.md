# agentic-lib Agentic Coding Systems SDK

Agentic Coding Systems SDK is a modern JavaScript library that provides a minimal command-line interface (CLI) for managing automated coding workflows and tasks. This version refines the CLI to its essentials, focusing on command-line argument handling and providing placeholder commands for future enhancements.

## Installation

Install the SDK via npm:

```bash
npm install agentic-lib
```

## Quick Start

```

## CLI Commands

- **self-test**: Runs the self-test suite to validate internal operations. (Placeholder implementation)
- **demo**: Executes a demonstration of core functionalities. (Placeholder implementation)
- **help**: Displays detailed usage instructions.

## API Documentation

The library currently provides a minimal CLI interface. Future versions will expand the capabilities of the SDK, including features such as:

- Publishing packages
- Running tests
- Managing tasks
- Updating dependencies
- Formatting and linting code
- Integrating with OpenAI API for automated code reviews and suggestions
