# intentïon agentic-lib

You probably want to start with the workflow documentation here: [WORKFLOWS-README.md](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/blob/main/WORKFLOWS-README.md)

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your
repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate through branches and
issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using
GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

## Overview

agentic‑lib provides a rich set of JavaScript functions that mirror GitHub Actions workflows. It includes telemetry gathering, Kafka simulations, remote service wrappers, advanced LLM delegation, and parsing utilities enabling automated CI/CD integrations.

### Key Features

- **Usage Information:**  
  Use `generateUsage()` to display available flag options.
- **Telemetry:**  
  Comprehensive diagnostics including `gatherTelemetryData()`, `gatherExtendedTelemetryData()`, `gatherAdvancedTelemetryData()`, and `gatherFullTelemetryData()`.
- **Remote Service Wrappers:**  
  Simplified API interactions for deployment, build status, analytics, notifications, logging, and repository details.
- **LLM Delegation:**  
  Advanced functions supporting robust decision delegation with schema validation and timeout support.
- **Kafka Operations:**  
  Simulated messaging for inter-workflow communication using Kafka-like functions.
- **SARIF Parsing:**  
  Functions such as `parseVitestSarifOutput` and `parseEslintDetailedOutput` for parsing SARIF outputs.

## Recent Improvements

- Extended flag handling with improved diagnostics and error checking.
- Enhanced telemetry and Kafka simulation functions with detailed logging and metrics.
- Advanced LLM delegation functions with strict schema validation and timeout support.
- **New:** Added wrappers for remote repository and logging services.
- **Updated:** Refreshed README documentation to align with CONTRIBUTING guidelines.

## Component Breakdown

This repository is organized into three distinct areas to help you understand the purpose and maturity level of each component:

### 1. Re‑usable Workflows (Core Functionality)
- **Purpose:**  
  These workflows form the backbone of the agentic‑lib system, enabling automated coding processes such as testing, publishing, and issue management.
- **Stability:**  
  They are stable and well‑tested, designed to be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines.
- **Licensing:**  
  The core workflows are released under GPL‑3 and include an attribution requirement for any derived work.
- **Location:**  
  Find these in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

### 2. Example Workflows (Demonstrative Content)
- **Purpose:**  
  These files provide practical examples of how to use the core workflows. They serve as learning tools and reference implementations.
- **Stability:**  
  While functional, they are intended primarily for demonstration and experimentation.
- **Licensing:**  
  The example workflows are covered by the MIT license to allow for broader use and modification.
- **Location:**  
  Look in the `examples/` directory for sample implementations.

### 3. The Evolving main.js (JavaScript re-implementation of Re‑usable Workflows)
- **Purpose:**  
  This file implements the Re‑usable Workflows above as a JavaScript module, enabling programmatic access to the core functionality.
- **Stability:**  
  It is under active development and may change frequently. It represents bleeding‑edge functionality that might not yet be production‑ready.
- **Licensing:**  
  As part of the core project, it is under GPL‑3 with the attribution clause.
- **Location:**  
  The code is located in `src/lib/main.js`.
