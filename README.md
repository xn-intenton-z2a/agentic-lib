# intentïon agentic-lib

You probably want to start with the workflow documentation here: [WORKFLOWS-README.md](WORKFLOWS-README.md)

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your
repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate through branches and
issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using
GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

## New Exported Utility Functions

- `generateUsage()`: Provides a usage message updated with the new flags.
- `getIssueNumberFromBranch(branch, prefix)`: Extracts an issue number from a branch name. (Updated regex for better digit capturing)
- `sanitizeCommitMessage(message)`: Cleans up commit messages removing unsupported characters.
- `splitArguments(args)`: Splits a list of arguments into flags and non-flag arguments.
- `processFlags(flags)`: Processes the given flags and returns a summary message.
- `enhancedDemo()`: Returns an enhanced demo message that includes environment details.
- `logEnvironmentDetails()`: Logs environment details, such as the NODE_ENV setting.
- `showVersion()`: Returns the current version of the library. Use the `--version` flag to display the version.

## Future Enhancements

The current version synchronizes the README with the behavior of our evolving main.js implementation. Future enhancements include:

- Advanced flag parsing strategies and more robust error handling.
- Additional utility functions to further enhance workflow automation.
- Improved integration with GitHub's API for dynamic issue and PR management.
- Enhanced logging and monitoring features to support continuous integration improvements.

## Component Breakdown

This repository is organized into three distinct areas to help you understand the purpose and maturity level of each component:

### 1. Re‑usable Workflows (Core Functionality)
- **Purpose:**  
  These workflows form the backbone of the agentic‑lib system, enabling automated coding processes such as testing, publishing, and issue management.
- **Stability:**  
  They are stable and well‑tested, designed to be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines.
- **Licensing:**  
  The core workflows are released under GPL‑3 and include an attribution requirement for any derived work.
- **Location:**  
  Find these in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

### 2. Example Workflows (Demonstrative Content)
- **Purpose:**  
  These files provide practical examples of how to use the core workflows. They serve as learning tools and reference implementations.
- **Stability:**  
  While functional, they are intended primarily for demonstration and experimentation.
- **Licensing:**  
  The example workflows are covered by the MIT license to allow for broader use and modification.
- **Location:**  
  Look in the `examples/` directory for sample implementations.

### 3. The Evolving main.js (JavaScript re-implementation of Re‑usable Workflows)
- **Purpose:**  
  This file implements the Re‑usable Workflows above as a JavaScript module, enabling programmatic access to the core functionality.
- **Stability:**  
  It is under active development and may change frequently. It represents bleeding‑edge functionality that might not yet be production‑ready.
- **Licensing:**  
  As part of the core project, it is under GPL‑3 with the attribution clause.
- **Location:**  
  The code is located in `src/lib/main.js`.
