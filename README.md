# intentïon agentic-lib

You probably want to start with the workflow documentation here: [WORKFLOWS-README.md](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/blob/main/WORKFLOWS-README.md)

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your
repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate through branches and
issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using
GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

## Component Breakdown

This repository is organized into three distinct areas to help you understand the purpose and maturity level of each component:

### 1. Re‑usable Workflows (Core Functionality)
- **Purpose:**  
  These workflows form the backbone of the agentic‑lib system, enabling automated coding processes such as testing, publishing, and issue management.
- **Stability:**  
  They are stable and well‑tested, designed to be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines.
- **Licensing:**  
  The core workflows are released under GPL‑3 and include an attribution requirement for any derived work.
- **Location:**  
  Find these in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

### 2. Example Workflows (Demonstrative Content)
- **Purpose:**  
  These files provide practical examples of how to use the core workflows. They serve as learning tools and reference implementations.
- **Stability:**  
  While functional, they are intended primarily for demonstration and experimentation.
- **Licensing:**  
  The example workflows are covered by the MIT license to allow for broader use and modification.
- **Location:**  
  Look in the `examples/` directory for sample implementations.

### 3. The Evolving main.js (JavaScript re‑implementation of Re‑usable Workflows)
- **Purpose:**  
  This file implements the Re‑usable Workflows above as a JavaScript module, enabling programmatic access to the core functionality.
- **Stability:**  
  It is under active development and may change frequently. It represents bleeding‑edge functionality that might not yet be production‑ready.
- **Licensing:**  
  As part of the core project, it is under GPL‑3 with the attribution clause.
- **Location:**  
  The code is located in `src/lib/main.js`.

## AWS Integrations

The agentic‑lib library leverages AWS services to enhance automation and reliability:

- **SQS Integration:**
  - The function `createSQSEventFromDigest` constructs a mock AWS SQS event from a given digest, formatting the payload to resemble a typical SQS message.
  - The `digestLambdaHandler` function processes incoming SQS events, gracefully handling JSON parsing errors and accumulating failed records. If a messageId is omitted, a fallback identifier is generated.
  - These integrations ensure that messages can be retried by AWS SQS in case of processing errors, thereby enhancing fault tolerance.

- **Logging:**
  - Detailed logging via `logInfo` and `logError` functions provides insight into the operations, including configurations and error stacks when verbose mode is enabled.

## CLI Behavior

The CLI provides several flags to manage the library's operation:

- **--help:**
  - Displays usage instructions and available command line flags.
- **--digest:**
  - Initiates the processing of a sample digest by creating a simulated SQS event and handling it through the AWS-integrated lambda handler.
- **--verbose:**
  - Activates detailed logging for debugging purposes.
- **--diagnostics:**
  - Outputs an in-depth diagnostic report, including the current configuration, Node.js version, and relevant environment variables.
