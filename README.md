## Component Breakdown

This repository is organized into three distinct areas to help you understand the purpose and maturity level of each component:

### 1. Re‑usable Workflows (Core Functionality)
- **Purpose:**  
  These workflows form the backbone of the agentic‑lib system, enabling automated coding processes such as testing, publishing, and issue management.
- **Stability:**  
  They are stable and well‑tested, designed to be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines.
- **Licensing:**  
  The core workflows are released under GPL‑3 and include an attribution requirement for any derived work.
- **Location:**  
  Find these in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

### 2. Example Workflows (Demonstrative Content)
- **Purpose:**  
  These files provide practical examples of how to use the core workflows. They serve as learning tools and reference implementations.
- **Stability:**  
  While functional, they are intended primarily for demonstration and experimentation.
- **Licensing:**  
  The example workflows are covered by the MIT license to allow for broader use and modification.
- **Location:**  
  Look in the `examples/` directory for sample implementations.

### 3. The Evolving main.js (Experimental Work in Progress)
- **Purpose:**  
  This file showcases experimental features and serves as a testbed for integrating new ideas into the system.
- **Stability:**  
  It is under active development and may change frequently. It represents bleeding‑edge functionality that might not yet be production‑ready.
- **Licensing:**  
  As part of the core project, it is under GPL‑3 with the attribution clause.
- **Location:**  
  The experimental code is located in `src/lib/main.js`.
