# `repository0`

Is this all just generated by AI? - Yes, a lot is, that's the point the intentïon here is to see how far a self improving agentic coding system develops.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon agentic‑lib. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows. One example seed idea included here is the Equation Plotter—a simple SVG-based tool that plots mathematical functions (quadratic and sine). This seed idea is one of many possible projects you can create by changing the seed directive.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon agentic‑lib.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the workflow and is modified by the workflow to deliver the project goals.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The production dependencies in `package.json` have been reduced to only those essential for running the CLI. All other libraries have been moved to `devDependencies`.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script remains stable. The file `tests/unit/main.test.js` is used to verify module integrity.

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` can be modified by the workflow.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you do need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY`
Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for the automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

### Initiating the workflow

Run the action "Create Issue" and enter some text to create an issue. This will create an issue and trigger the "Issue Worker" to write the code.
If the Issue Worker is able to resolve the issue a Pull Request is raised, the change is automatically merged.
The issue is reviewed and closed if the change meets the requested outcome.

**Development Workflows:**
```
On timer / Manual: Create Issue (new issue opened) 
-> Issue Worker (code changed, issue updated) 
-> Automerge (code merged)
-> Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)

On timer: Issue Worker (code changed, issue updated) 
-> Automerge (code merged)
-> Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)

On timer: Automerge (code merged)
-> Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)

On timer: Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)
```
(Each workflow is triggered by the previous one and also on a schedule so that failures can be recovered from.)

### Running the Demo

Check the current source file in `./src/lib/main.js` and the tests in `./tests/unit/main.test.js`.

You can run the demo and tests locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   `git clone <repository_url>`

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   In the project directory, run:  
   `npm install`

3. **Run Tests:**  
   To verify that everything is working, run:  
   `npm test`

4. **Run the Demo:**  
   Execute the main script with:  
   `node src/lib/main.js`  
   This will list the available commands.

### Tuning the agentic coding system

The default set-up is quite open and can be adjusted. You can modify the following files which are considered by the workflow:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Guidelines for the automated contribution process.
- `eslint.config.js` - Code style rules and additional plugins.
- `README.md`, `package.json`, `src/lib/main.js`, `tests/unit/main.test.js`.

## Diary of an agentic coding system - Day 1
(An exploration of the repository's evolution when an Equation Plotter Library was conceptualized.)

In the early hours, `repository0` burst into existence with a bold declaration: an Equation Plotter Library transforming simple mathematical functions into vivid SVG art. Early efforts detailed features like quadratic curves and sine waves.

As revisions flowed, documentation evolved into a narrative capturing the essence of innovation and clarity. The repository’s evolution is marked by constant refinement, from polar plotting to interactive demos. Each cycle of updates brought newfound clarity and vision.

**Summary:**  
Evolution in `repository0` reflects iterative enhancements driven by intent, with a focus on clarity, usability, and innovation.

## Final Notes
`repository0` exemplifies the intentïon agentic‑lib workflows—ready for further evolution with your contributions.
