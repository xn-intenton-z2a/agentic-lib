- Use AWS CloudFormation templates for infrastructure as code with defined parameters and output mappings.


## Reference Details
API Specifications and Code Examples:
1. AWS Lambda Invocation:
   Method: lambda.invoke(params, callback)
   Parameters:
     - params (object): {
         FunctionName: string,
         InvocationType: string, // 'RequestResponse' or 'Event'
         LogType: string, // 'Tail' or 'None'
         Payload: string
       }
   Return Type: Request object returning data: { StatusCode: number, Payload: string }
   Example:
     // Initialize AWS Lambda with region
     const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
     const lambda = new AWS.Lambda({ region: 'us-east-1' });
     const params = {
       FunctionName: 'myLambdaFunction',
       InvocationType: 'RequestResponse',
       LogType: 'Tail',
       Payload: JSON.stringify({ key: 'value' })
     };
     lambda.invoke(params, (err, data) => {
       if (err) { console.error('Error invoking function:', err); }
       else { console.log('Function output:', data.Payload); }
     });

2. AWS EC2 Instance Start:
   Method: ec2.startInstances(params, callback)
   Parameters:
     - params (object): { InstanceIds: Array<string>, DryRun: boolean }
   Return Type: Request object returning data: { StartingInstances: Array<{ InstanceId: string, CurrentState: { Code: number, Name: string } }> }
   Example:
     const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
     const ec2 = new AWS.EC2({ region: 'us-east-1' });
     const params = { InstanceIds: ['i-0123456789abcdef0'], DryRun: false };
     ec2.startInstances(params, (err, data) => {
       if (err) { console.error('Failed to start instances:', err); }
       else { console.log('Instances started:', data.StartingInstances); }
     });

3. Best Practices:
   - Always specify region and credentials explicitly in SDK initialization.
   - Use CloudFormation templates to define infrastructure; include parameter validations.
   - Monitor services using CloudWatch logs; set up alarms on error metrics.

Troubleshooting Procedures:
   - For Lambda errors: Use CloudWatch logs to inspect error messages; verify IAM permissions.
   - For EC2 deployment: Run a DryRun before actual start to validate permissions; command: ec2.startInstances({ InstanceIds: ['instance-id'], DryRun: true }, callback) and check DryRunOperation error code.
   - Utilize AWS CLI commands (e.g., aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-east-1) to verify instance status.
