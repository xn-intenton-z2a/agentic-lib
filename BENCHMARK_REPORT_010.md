### Iterations

| # | Version | Run ID | Time | Duration | Transform? | PR | Source Lines | What Happened |
|---|---------|--------|------|----------|------------|-----|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | 7.4.17 | [23098153560](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/actions/runs/23098153560) | 22:55 | 6min | NO | -- | 48 | Supervisor tried `github:create-issue` but action parser didn't recognize pipe-delimited format. Logged `unknown:github:create-issue`. Dispatch used placeholder `<created_issue_number>`. Dev had nothing to do. **BUG: W1** |
| 2 | 7.4.17 | [23098409240](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/actions/runs/23098409240) | 23:05 | 12min | NO (maintain only) | -- | 48 | Same W1 bug. Maintain jobs wrote 4 feature specs + 6 library docs (2 maintain transforms). Supervisor again failed to create issue. **BUG: W1** |
| 3 | 7.4.18 | [23098736957](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/actions/runs/23098736957) | 23:31 | 6min | NO (maintain only) | -- | 48 | W1 fix worked — action routing now reaches executeCreateIssue. But LLM provided no params (`{action: "github:create-issue", params: {}}`). Logged `skipped:no-title`. **BUG: W4** |
| 4 | 7.4.20 | [23099060499](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/actions/runs/23099060499) | 23:52 | 12min | **YES** | [#3004](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/pull/3004) | 75 | W4 fix worked! Issues #3002, #3003 created. Dev transformed: `fizzbuzzNumber`, `fizzbuzzRange` implemented. PR merged. Post-commit tests pass. |
| 5 | 7.4.20 | [23099281976](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/actions/runs/23099281976) | 00:10 | 42min | **YES** | -- | 89 | Long iteration. review-features took 20+ min. More transforms (9 total). `fizzBuzz` and `fizzBuzzSingle` aliases added. Tests expanded. |
| 6 | 7.4.20 | [23099668678](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/actions/runs/23099668678) | 00:39 | pending | -- | -- | -- | In progress at time of report |

### Acceptance Criteria

| `fizzBuzz(0)` returns `[]` | **PASS** | Explicit `if (n === 0) return []` check |
| All unit tests pass | **PASS** | Post-commit tests passed on iterations 4 and 5 |
| README documents usage with examples | **NOT VERIFIED** | Not checked at time of report |

## Findings

### FINDING-1: Supervisor issue creation has two distinct failure modes (CRITICAL — FIXED)

**Mode 1 (W1)**: The LLM puts params inline in the action string — `github:create-issue | title: foo | body: bar` — but the action parser only checks the full string against the handler map. Fix: parse pipe-delimited inline params from action strings.

**Mode 2 (W4)**: The LLM calls the structured tool correctly but provides `{action: "github:create-issue", params: {}}` — no title, body, or feature at all. Fix: derive title from MISSION.md heading when no params provided.

Both bugs wasted 3 full workflow iterations (~700K tokens, ~30 min wall-clock). The fix chain was: W1 (v7.4.18) → W4 (v7.4.20), each requiring its own release+init cycle.

### FINDING-2: Multiple init purges per scenario are expensive (CONCERN)

The S1 scenario required 3 init purges due to version upgrades. Each init purge:
- Resets the logs branch (loses accumulated state)
- Resets source code to seed
- Adds ~2 min overhead
- Forces the pipeline to restart from scratch

This means the first 3 iterations' maintain transforms (feature specs, library docs) were thrown away by the v7.4.18 init, and those were thrown away again by the v7.4.20 init.

### FINDING-3: review-features job took 20+ minutes in iteration 5 (CONCERN)

The `review-features` job normally completes in ~30 seconds. In iteration 5, it ran for 20+ minutes. This suggests the LLM session got stuck or produced an extremely long response. This is a finding to investigate — it extended the iteration from the expected ~10 min to 42 min.

### FINDING-4: LLM creates duplicate issues (MINOR)

The supervisor created both #3002 and #3003 with nearly identical titles ("Implement FizzBuzz core functions..." vs "Implement FizzBuzz functions..."). The dedup guard didn't catch this because the titles differ slightly and both were created in the same iteration.

### FINDING-5: Code is functionally correct but tests don't exercise mission API names (OBSERVATION)

The tests import `fizzbuzzNumber` and `fizzbuzzRange` (the implementation's internal names) but not `fizzBuzz` and `fizzBuzzSingle` (the mission's required API names). The aliases exist and work, but aren't directly tested. The acceptance criteria would still pass in a live test, but this represents a gap in test coverage.

### FINDING-6: FizzBuzz should be the simplest benchmark — 3 wasted iterations is concerning (NEGATIVE)

FizzBuzz is explicitly labelled in ITERATION_BENCHMARKS_SIMPLE.md as "the simplest mission — if this fails, something fundamental is broken." The fact that 3 of 5 iterations were wasted on supervisor bugs suggests the supervisor prompt and tool schema need better validation. The implementation itself was correct on the first actual transform (iteration 4).

## Recommendations

1. **Add supervisor unit tests for issue creation** (HIGH) — Test that `executeCreateIssue` correctly handles: (a) inline pipe-delimited params, (b) structured tool params, (c) empty params with mission context fallback. These are now 3 known code paths.

2. **Improve tool schema for `report_supervisor_plan`** (HIGH) — The `params` field is `{type: "object"}` with no defined properties. Adding property definitions (title, body, labels, mode, issue-number) and marking title as required for `github:create-issue` would reduce LLM confusion.

3. **Add dedup guard for same-iteration issues** (LOW) — The dedup guard checks for recently-closed issues but not for same-session duplicates. When the supervisor creates 2 actions, both could be create-issue with similar titles.

4. **Investigate review-features timeouts** (MEDIUM) — Add a hard timeout to the review-features job to prevent 20+ minute sessions. The job should complete in under 2 minutes for simple missions.

5. **Consider hot-fixing without init purge** (MEDIUM) — The current fix cycle (branch → PR → CI → merge → release → init purge) requires restarting the entire scenario. A mechanism to update the agentic-step action in-place (without resetting logs/state/source) would avoid losing accumulated progress.
