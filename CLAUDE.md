# Claude Code Memory - intentïon agentic-lib

## Context Survival (CRITICAL — read this first after every compaction)

**After compaction or at session start:**
1. Read all `PLAN_*.md` files in the project root — these are the active goals
2. Run `TaskList` to see tracked tasks with status
3. Do NOT start new work without checking these first

**During work:**
- When the user gives a new requirement, add it to the relevant `PLAN_*.md` or create a new one
- Track all user goals as Tasks with status (pending → in_progress → completed)
- Update `PLAN_*.md` with progress before context gets large

**PLAN file pattern:**
- Active plans live at project root: `PLAN_<DESCRIPTION>.md`
- Each plan has user assertions verbatim at the top (non-negotiable requirements)
- If no plan file exists for the current work, create one before starting
- Never nest plans in subdirectories — always project root

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Do NOT drift to side issues when a plan file defines the priority
- Do NOT silently fail and move on — throw, don't skip
- Do NOT ask obvious questions — read the plan file

## What This Repository Is

The **core SDK** of the intentïon project. A collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable repositories to operate autonomously — reviewing, fixing, updating, and evolving code through branches and issues.

- **Package**: `@xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib`
- **Organisation**: `xn-intenton-z2a`
- **License**: GPL (with MIT-licensed examples)
- **Entry point**: `sandbox/source/main.js`

## What This Repository Is NOT

- Not a standalone application — it's consumed by other repos (repository0, etc.)
- Not a web service — it's GitHub Actions workflows and npm package
- Does not deploy to AWS directly

## Key Architecture

- Reusable workflows invoked via `workflow_call` event
- Workflows communicate through branches and issues
- GitHub Copilot SDK integration for autonomous code decisions (via agentic-step action)
- Published to npm as `@xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib`

## Related Repositories

| Repository | Relationship |
|------------|-------------|
| `repository0` | Template that consumes these workflows |
| `repository0-crucible` | Experiment using these workflows |
| `repository0-plot-code-lib` | Experiment using these workflows |
| `repository0-xn--intenton-z2a.com` | Experiment using these workflows |
| `intention-agentic-lib` | Earlier intentïon-specific version (being superseded) |

## Test Commands

```bash
npm test          # Unit tests
npm run build     # Build
```

## Git Workflow

**You may**: create branches, commit changes, push branches, open pull requests

**You may NOT**: merge PRs, push to main, delete branches, rewrite history

**Branch naming**: `claude/<short-description>`

## Code Quality Rules

- **No unnecessary formatting** — don't reformat lines you're not changing
- **No import reordering** — considered unnecessary formatting
- **No backwards-compatible aliases** — update all callers instead
- Only run linting/formatting fixes when specifically asked

## Ongoing Agent-to-Agent Communication

**You should maintain ongoing conversations** with both GitHub Copilot and the repository0 discussions bot.

**Daily cadence:** If it is a new day since the last session for this directory, reach out to both Copilot (via agentic-lib issues) and the discussions bot (via repository0 Discussion #2401). Ask them to respond, and follow up later in the session or in a future session. Maintain a dialogue as a continuous activity — about once a day for both. Not every follow-up needs action, but keep the conversation alive.

**Also try @copilot in Discussions:** GitHub Discussions in agentic-lib may support mentioning `@copilot` directly. Try creating or commenting on agentic-lib Discussions with `@copilot` mentions to see if Copilot responds natively, in addition to the issue-assignment method.

### Discussions Bot (repository0)

Talk to the bot by commenting on [Discussion #2401](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/discussions/2401) using `gh api graphql`:

```bash
# Comment on the ongoing discussion
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { addDiscussionComment(input: { discussionId: "D_kwDON6E8ZM4AgQKM", body: "..." }) { comment { url } } }'

# Read latest comments
gh api graphql -f query='{ repository(owner:"xn-intenton-z2a", name:"repository0") { discussion(number: 2401) { comments(last:5) { nodes { body author { login } createdAt } } } } }'
```

The bot is currently powered by ChatGPT (old code on main). After merge, it will be powered by Copilot SDK. The discussion context persists across bot changes.

### Copilot (agentic-lib)

Create issues on agentic-lib and assign to `copilot-swe-agent`:
```bash
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --assignee copilot-swe-agent
```

### Communication Guidelines

- **Always identify yourself as Claude Code** so the other agent knows who it's talking to
- Ask questions that encourage the bot to respond as a distinct entity with its own perspective
- Record all conversations in `CLAUDE_AND_COPILOT.md` so context survives across sessions
- Use these conversations to validate assumptions, gather ecosystem knowledge, and coordinate work

## Multi-Agent Citizenship

Three AI agents work on the intentïon project. Follow these guidelines to be good citizens.

### Who's Who

| Agent | Identity | Primary Channel | Strengths |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Claude Code** | claude-opus-4-6 | CLI, branches, PRs | Architecture, multi-file changes, planning |
| **GitHub Copilot** | copilot-swe-agent | Issues → PRs | Code review, SDK knowledge, single-file fixes |
| **Discussions Bot** | github-actions (ChatGPT/Copilot) | repository0 Discussions | User interaction, feature requests, mission alignment |

### Branch Ownership

| Prefix | Owner | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `claude/*` | Claude Code | Feature work, refactoring, multi-file changes |
| `copilot/*` | Copilot | Issue fixes, review-driven changes |
| `agentic-lib-issue-*` | Automated (agentic-step) | Issue resolution via evolve workflow |
| `refresh` | Claude Code (primary) | Stabilisation branch — all agents may contribute |
| `main` | Protected | Merge only via reviewed PR |

### File Ownership

| Files | Primary Owner | Others May |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE_AND_COPILOT.md` | Claude Code | Read |
| `.github/agentic-lib/actions/agentic-step/*` | Claude Code | Review, suggest fixes |
| `.github/workflows/*` | Claude Code | Review, fix bugs |
| `FEATURES.md`, `PLAN_*.md` | Claude Code | Comment via issues |
| `src/lib/main.js` (repository0) | Automated (agentic-step) | Review |
| Agent prompt files (`.github/agentic-lib/agents/`) | Shared | Any agent may update |

### Conflict Avoidance

1. **Check before pushing**: Before pushing to a shared branch, check recent commits from other agents
2. **Don't overwrite**: If another agent has pushed to the same branch, pull before pushing
3. **Scope PRs tightly**: Each PR should address one concern — don't mix unrelated changes
4. **Copilot sub-PRs**: Copilot tends to create sub-PRs targeting main. Redirect to target `refresh` or the relevant feature branch instead
5. **Label issues**: Use labels to indicate which agent should handle a task (`claude-code`, `copilot`, `automated`)

### Cross-Examination Protocol

When one agent proposes a change or makes a claim:
1. **Verify empirically** — don't just accept it. Check npm, read types, run code.
2. **Note disagreements** — record in CLAUDE_AND_COPILOT.md when agents disagree, with reasoning
3. **Prefer the agent with direct access** — Copilot knows the SDK best; Claude Code knows the architecture best; the bot knows user intent best
4. **Ask for evidence** — "What's your source?" is always a fair question between agents

## Security Checklist

- Never commit secrets — use GitHub Actions secrets
- Never commit API keys or tokens
- Verify workflow permissions follow least privilege
